ActDisNeutT0Opt3

ActDisRecruit1Opt3
[npc], [job], of [node], a suspected Resistance member was executed today by a public roboHanger
ActDisRecruit2Opt0
Why would anyone want to join the Resistance, mocked [mayor]? Who wants to die wearing last weeks clothes and half starved?
ActDisRecruit2Opt1
Do people ever join the Resistance voluntarily, wondered [mayor]? Or are they coerced with threats of violence to their loved ones?
ActDisRecruit2Opt2
[city] offers work, food and shelter for all citizens. Why join the Resistance when there is a ServoPod here with your name on it, asks [mayor]?

ActDisRiot0Opt3

ActDisRiot1Opt0
The death of an innocent citizen during the riots [daysAgo], centred on [node] is a sad day for the city

ActDisTracer1Opt0
It's important that citizens report any suspicious looking devices attached to high vantage points, said [mayor] when asked about Resistance spy tech

ActDisTracer1Opt2
[mayor] ordered a bug hunt yesterday at [node]. All citizens were encouraged to search for Resistance spy tech that is rumoured to be present
ActDisTracer1Opt3

Will the Resistance give [who] any of their illegal gear so they have enough [money], asks [npc] of [node]?

ActGea2Opt1
I think it's sad that the Resistance puts so much effort into sourcing expensive, illegal gear when they could be helping us, says [npc] of [node]
ActGea2Opt2
Special gear. Why does the Resistance bother? Couldn't they use what everybody else does, asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
ActGea3Opt0
My [who] once stole some Resistance pills. That's why they are an incontinent drooler. Scary stuff, says [npc], [job], of [node]
ActGea3Opt1
Illegal gear is illegal for a reason. Doesn't the Resistance know that a lot of it is harmful to the user, asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
ActGea3Opt2
You know what happens to you if you're found with illegal Resistance gear in your possession, asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
ActGea4Opt0
Pawn a piece of Resistance gear and you've got enough money for a coach passage to the Moon, insists [npc], [job], of [node]

Rumour has it that Resistance gear is neuro tagged. If the wrong person uses it then it's lights out for them, says [npc], [job], of [node]

HQ0Opt0
Does [side] HQ care about anything other than pushing their own wheelbarrow, asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
HQ0Opt1
Does [side] HQ care about we little people or are we just tiny cogs in their huge wheel, asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
HQ0Opt2
I get the impression that the hobnobs at [side] HQ are living in a magic bubble of abundance. Must be nice, says [npc], [job], of [node]
HQ0Opt3
If I was a paid up member of [side] HQ I probably wouldn't care about the little people either. As long as my shoes were shined, says [npc] of [node]
HQ1Opt0
When was the last time you saw a member of [side] HQ step down from above and mingle with we little people, asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
HQ1Opt1
My [who] is convinced that [side] HQ is nothing more than a continuous orgy of drugs, booze and pleasure, says [npc], [job], of [node]
HQ1Opt2
I'd like to know what [side] HQ is doing for we little people? When was the last time they helped anyone, asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
HQ1Opt3
As far as I can tell all that happens at [side] HQ is a whole lot of squabbling about nothing. Waste of space the lot of them, says [npc] of [node]
HQ2Opt0
Supposedly our betters at [side] HQ are doing a masterful job on our behalf, says [npc], [job], of [node]. Who believes that?
HQ2Opt1
If it wasn't for my [handicap] I'd round up every last member of [side] HQ and knock some sense into them, says [npc], [job], of [node]
HQ2Opt2
Other than fighting among themselves what do they do at [side] HQ? I'd like to know, says [npc], [job], of [node]
HQ2Opt3
Is [side] HQ corrupt? Is the sky blue?  You can't trust any of them. Nothing but wasters and bludgers, says [npc], [job], of [node]
HQ3Opt0
My [who] asked me the other day if [side] HQ were efficient? How the heck do I know, says [npc], [job], of [node]?
HQ3Opt1
Ants are efficient. So are cockroaches. [side] HQ aren't. Nothing but a bunch of oxygen thieves, says [npc], [job], of [node]
HQ3Opt2
[side] HQ have their finger on the pulse. Don't believe the doubters, they really know what's going on, says [npc], [job], of [node]
HQ3Opt3
I'm a big believer in [side] HQ. They are here to make my life better. How? I'm not exactly sure but I'm hoping, says [npc], [job], of [node]
HQ4Opt0
[side] HQ don't tolerate internal squabbling. Apparently. Not from what I've heard, says [npc], [job], of [node]
HQ4Opt1
Rumour has it that there are strict protocols in place at [side] HQ to prevent factional disputes, says [npc], [job], of [node]
HQ4Opt2
Of course [side] HQ is nothing more than a bunch of squabbling schoolchildren. Everybody knows that, says [npc], [job], of [node]
HQ5Opt0
Is there any point in expecting [side] HQ to behave like adults, asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
HQ5Opt1
I'm a firm believer in [side] HQ. Without their guiding hand there would be chaos and anarchy, says [npc], [job], of [node]
HQ5Opt2
[side] HQ? Great bunch of people. Professional, competent and on the ball, insists [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes0Opt0
They say those [cap3s] don't forget nuffin. They can keep firing questions till the sun burns out, says [npc] of [node]
CapRes0Opt1
Relentless. That's what those [cap3s] are, damn relentless, says [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes0Opt2
My [who] is scared that one of those [cap3s] is going to squeeze them dry one day. What's there to squeeze, asks [npc] of [node]?
CapRes0Opt3
You get wired up before those [cap3s] come for you. Sit their like a damn Christmas tree, laments [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes1Opt0
My [who] had to face an [cap3] and all they can do now is dribble. It's embarrassing, says [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes1Opt1
My [who] claims they saw an [cap3] once. Insisted that it did THINGS to them. Sadly, not enough, says [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes1Opt2
I'd rather have a frontal lobotomy than have to face one of those [cap3s], says [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes1Opt3
My [who] was turned fruit loop crazy by one of those [cap3s] insists [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes2Opt0
Those [cap2s] play on your emotions like the Devil plays the fiddle, says [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes2Opt1
Those [cap2s] tear away your emotional defences like a kid opening a birthday present, says [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes2Opt2
My [who] tried to face down an [cap2] once. Now they just sit in the corner and wee on the carpet, says [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes2Opt3
Those [cap2s] are trained to hunt down your inner fears like a hound dog after a wounded hare, says [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes3Opt0
My [who] was [npcIs] until they were worked over by an [cap2]. Can't stop crying now. It's a shame, says [npc] of [node]
CapRes3Opt1
Those [cap2s] have some kind of evil Jedi training that lets them suck you dry of all emotions until you are nothing but a husk, says [npc]
CapRes3Opt2
They're aliens, those [cap2s]. From another dimension. Soul suckers, that's what they are, says [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes3Opt3
Nobody has ever gone up against a [cap2] and won, that I know of, insists [npc], [job], of [node]. Why even try?
CapRes4Opt0
[cap1s]? They have those things? Weren't they declared illegal by the guvumunt, asks [npc] of [node]?
CapRes4Opt1
My [who] was worked over by a [cap1] and now they poop into a bag. Phewee! Frightens the heck out me, says [npc] of [node]
CapRes4Opt2
Who built those [cap1s]? Should be banned. They're inhuman. Use them on goats if you want but not us, says [npc] of [node]
CapRes4Opt3
The [cap1s] don't let you scream. They shoot you full of anti-scream cream before drilling out your kneecaps, says [npc] of [node]
CapRes5Opt0
Can you hire out a [cap1]? I'd like to use it on my [who], says [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes5Opt1
Sometimes those [cap1s] fry a circuit and rip people apart. All that's left is a pile of bloody mince, says [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes5Opt2
My [who] swears that they could go ten rounds with a [cap1]. Tell them that they're dreaming, says [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes5Opt3
Had a dream about a [cap1] last night says [npc], [job], of [node]. Woke up and found my pillow shredded
CapRes6Opt0
[cap0] and the Hell tank. Man, what a combination. Run for the hills, is my advice, says [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes6Opt1
It's a perk of the job that [cap0] gets to lock up people in the Hell Tank. Fun and giggles all around, says [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes6Opt2
My [who] volunteered to test a Hell Tank. All we got back was their nose ring and a thank you note, says [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes6Opt3
What happens in a Hell Tank? You aren't having tea and scones with Lucifer, that's for sure, says [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes7Opt0
My [who] spent time in a Hell Tank and now they won't stop screaming. Going to have to be put down, says [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes7Opt1
Is [cap0] really that evil? If it wasn't for them dunking people into the Hell Tank it'd be hard to tell, says [npc], [job], of [node]
CapRes7Opt2
[cap0] put [npc] who is [npcIs] into a Hell Tank. I'm going to have to write to the guvumunt about that, says [npc] of [node]
CapRes7Opt3
If they gave me enough [money] I'd volunteer to test out a Hell Tank. They're always looking for idiots like me, says [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyConRes0Opt0
Man, that [drug] is mean and nasty. My [who] took some and they haven't got off the toilet since, says [actor], [job] of [node]
PlyConRes0Opt1
Is [drug] illegal? My [who] takes it all the time and tells me that it isn't but they are totally spaced so who knows, asks [actor] of [node]
PlyConRes0Opt2
I've never tried [drug] but I've heard that it's a real send your head to the outer belt trip, says [actor], [job] of [node]
PlyConRes0Opt3
[drug], wow! Got to get some of that, says [actor] of [node]. You reporters know where stuff is, don't you?
PlyConRes1Opt0
My [who] is hooked on [drug]. Locked up in a room, apparently, with pink and padded walls. Nasty, says [actor] of [node]
PlyConRes1Opt1
I've heard that you can get addicted to [drug] real easy if you're not careful, says [actor], [job] of [node]
PlyConRes1Opt2
They say that once you're addicted to [drug] it's worse than having a nanoBot go rogue in your guts, says [actor] of [node]
PlyConRes1Opt3
[drug]? Yeah, I take it, so what, says [actor], [job] of [node]? Hasn't done me any harm yet
PlyConRes2Opt0
I heard that my [who] got hooked on [drug] and started oozing green lizard goo out their ass, says [actor], [job] of [node]
PlyConRes2Opt1
[drug] is great. Can't manage without it, says [actor], [job] of [node]. Keeps me focused. Balanced. Creative.
PlyConRes2Opt2
The Authority don't like you taking [drug], that's for sure. My [who] got caught and was sent to the MedTest prison, says [actor]
PlyConRes2Opt3
You know what happens when the Authority catches you taking [drug], asks [actor] of [node]? They use you as a MedTest dummy
PlyConRes3Opt0
I've heard that the [mayor] is on [drug]. Has it for breakfast, says [actor], [job] of [node]. That's why they're so scary
PlyConRes3Opt1
Saw a man on [drug] go ape and take out three TidyBots all on his own, says [actor], [job] of [node]
PlyConRes3Opt2
My [who] thinks that [drug] is made from ground up Belters. You know, the ones that got lost in space, says [actor] of [node]
PlyConRes3Opt3
Down deep in the carbon mines, that's where [drug] comes from, says [actor], [job] of [node]. The Corps control it all
PlyConRes4Opt0
Those Ripperdocs are one of a kind. Not the sort of people you want anything to do with, says [npc], [job] of [node]

PlyConRes4Opt1
My [who] visited a Ripperdoc once and have been a mess ever since. Their own fault if you ask me, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyConRes4Opt2
I know more about hygiene than most Ripperdocs, says [npc], [job] of [node]. Filthy, all of them

PlyConRes4Opt3
Ripperdocs might fix your problem but they'll give you two more as a replacement, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyConRes5Opt0
Is there a school for Ripperdocs? Don't they teach them about hygiene? Not for me, thanks, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyConRes5Opt1
Ripperdocs are supposed to be rough. That's their job. Surgery done fast. Shame about their hygiene, says [npc] of [node]

PlyConRes5Opt2
The day I visit a Ripperdoc is the day I give up on life, says [npc], [job] of [node]. They eat their food with their instruments

PlyConRes5Opt3
My [who] asked if there is a certified Ripperdoc in our district? I just laughed, says [npc], [job] of [node]. Certified!

PlyConRes6Opt0
The problem with Medics is that they have to report everything and everyone, says [npc], [job] of [node]. It's a pain

PlyConRes6Opt1
It's not easy finding a Medic that doesn't feel obliged to tell the Authority all about you and your problems, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyConRes6Opt2
I like Medics because they wash their hands and their instruments. Ripperdocs don't, says [npc], [job] of [node]

PlyConRes6Opt3
My [who] badly needs to see a Medic but can't afford to. They're asking me to help but what with, says [npc], [job] of [node]?

PlyConRes7Opt0
Why does seeing a Medic cost so much. I haven't seen one since I got my [handicap], can't afford it, says [npc] of [node]
PlyConRes7Opt1
[mayor] promised to make Medics more affordable but, what do you know, they aren't? No surprise there, says [npc] of [node]

PlyConRes7Opt2
Nobody that I know can afford to see a Medic. Not a proper one, anyway. Ripperdocs are cheaper, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyConRes7Opt3
A medic could fix my [handicap], I'm sure of it. But where do I get the money to pay for it, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?

PlyConRes8Opt0
Those reskin shops, I don't know. Who wants a new face anyway? What's wrong with the one you've got, asks [npc] of [node]?

PlyConRes8Opt1
My [who] went to a reskin shop and came out looking like a cane toad. The recognition AI will have fun with that, says [npc] of [node]
PlyConRes8Opt2
Once you've had a facial reskin, that's it, there's no going back, says [npc], [job] of [node]

PlyConRes8Opt3
If you want a facial reskin they'll do it but you don't get to choose what your new face will be like, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyConRes9Opt0
My [who] gets a new facial reskin every year. Just so they can shove it to the AI, says [npc], [job] of [node]

PlyConRes9Opt1
My [who] had a reskin after an accident and now they have two chins and a nose like a fire hose, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyConRes9Opt2
Would I ever choose to get a facial reskin? No, I'm far too sensible for that, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyConRes9Opt3
Do those reskin shops use vat grown skin or that slimy plant stuff? Is there any way to tell, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?

PlyConRes10Opt0
Would I let a stranger inject an antidote into me, asks [npc], [job] of [node]? I would if I was dying

PlyConRes10Opt1
Those geneticists have made so many new diseases that they've lost count of them, says [npc], [job] of [node]

PlyConRes10Opt2
My [who] thinks that all geneticists should be rounded up and fed to the pigs. Can't disagree, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyConRes10Opt3
Geneticists are supposed to be the way of the future but all they've done is bring back the past with endless plagues, says [npc]
PlyConRes11Opt0
Geneticistics have caused my [handicap], I'm sure of it. One of those custom made bugs did it, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyConRes11Opt1
You can't trust a geneticist. They'll inject you full of viruses and send you off to infect everybody you know, says [npc] of [node]
PlyConRes11Opt2
My [who] has signed up as a medical test subject for genetic treatments. Pays great but, wow, what a risk, says [npc]

PlyConRes11Opt3
My [who] has a kid who want's to be a geneticist and make viruses that'll kill us all. That's a scary kid, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyConRes12Opt0
Those TechHeads drill holes in your skull and ram all kinds of sh*t straight into your squishy matter, says [npc], of [node]
PlyConRes12Opt1
I've heard that the TechHeads use bioSpiders. Let them crawl in through your ear and rummage around your brain, says [npc] of [node]
PlyConRes12Opt2
Would I ever visit a TechHead? Do I look like somebody who wants backyard brain surgery, asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
PlyConRes12Opt3
My [who] saw a TechHead last year and now they are an incontinent imbecile. Stay away, is my advice, says [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyConRes13Opt0
[mayor] tried to pass a law banning TechHeads but how would the Authority enforce it when they are invisible, asks [npc] of [node]?
PlyConRes13Opt1
TechHeads turn your brain into scrambled egg yolk and let it dribble out your nose, warns [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyConRes13Opt2
The scariest thing about TechHeads is the stuff that they don't tell you. Like what do they actually do inside your head, asks [npc] of [node]?
PlyConRes13Opt3
They say that TechHeads practise on dogs. That's why there are so many mutant, killer, hounds here in [city], says [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyDisBlow0Opt0
I was near the [genLoc] that blew up at [node], [daysAgo], says [npc], [job]. Knocked me clean off my feet, it did
PlyDisBlow0Opt1
My [who] was at the [genLoc] at [node] when the bomb went off, [daysAgo], says [npc], [job]. They aren't doing well
PlyDisBlow0Opt2
How many people died at the [genLoc] at [node] when that bomb went off [daysAgo]? I seem to recall that it was a lot, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisBlow1Opt0
I regularly walk past the [genLoc] at [node] where the bomb went off [daysAgo], says [npc], [job]. Boy, am I lucky
PlyDisBlow1Opt1
The [genLoc] that the Resistance bombed at [node], [daysAgo], was very popular. Why did they do that, asks [npc]?
PlyDisBlow1Opt2
There's a way to gain support and bombing places like the [genLoc] at [node], [daysAgo], isn't it, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisBlow2Opt0
The Resistance needs to know that my [who] was killed at the [genLoc] at [node] when they bombed it [daysAgo], says [npc]
PlyDisBlow2Opt1
What purpose is there in bombing our [genLoc] here at [node] asks [npc], [job]? What is wrong with the Resistance?
PlyDisBlow2Opt2
There were children at the [genLoc] at [node] when the Resistance bombed it [daysAgo], says [npc], [job]. What were they thinking?
PlyDisBlow3Opt0
I can't understand why the Resistance thinks that bombing our [genLoc] here at [node], [daysAgo] was a good idea, asks [npc], [job]?
PlyDisBlow3Opt1
I saw pictures of the [genLoc] at [node] that the Resistance bombed [daysAgo], says [npc], [job]. They made me sick
PlyDisBlow3Opt2
Ugly is what it is. Blowing up a [genLoc] here at [node], [daysAgo], for no good reason. Shame on the Resistance, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisGear0Opt0
There's people here at [node] who know where to get stuff. Special stuff, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisGear0Opt1
My [who] says that they deal gear to the Resistance, says [npc], [job], of [node]. Deal grief, more likely
PlyDisGear0Opt2
Everybody knows that if you want to source special gear you need to talk to [npc] at [node]. They can get you anything, says [npc]
PlyDisGear1Opt0
There's a man down the road from me who has lots of unannounced meetings late at night, say [npc], [job], of [node]. Mysterious
PlyDisGear1Opt1
[mayor] says it's illegal to deal gear to the Resistance but, man, can you make some money out of it, says [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyDisGear1Opt2
It's risky doing business with the Resistance here at [node]. [citys] security forces are all over us, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisGear2Opt0
My [who] tried to sell gear to the Resistance and got kneecapped for their troubles. Not that it worried me, says [npc] of [node]
PlyDisGear2Opt1
I knew somebody who fenced broken gear to the Resistance, here at [node], says [npc]. They found him in a dumpster, burnt to a crisp
PlyDisGear2Opt2
If you want illegal items, the good stuff, you have to speak to [npc] at [node]. They can be found at the [genLoc] most days
PlyDisGear3Opt0
Selling gear to the Resistance can be very lucrative, I've heard. says [npc], [job], of [node]. Not that i'd know anything about it
PlyDisGear3Opt1
The Resistance makes a point of hunting down anyone who double crosses them with dodgy gear, says [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyDisGear3Opt2
[mayor] is trying to stamp out the gear dealers here at [node], says [npc], but what hope have they got when it's so lucrative?
PlyDisHack0Opt0
The local grid here at [node] went down [daysAgo] says [npc], [job]. What hope do I have with my [handicap]?
PlyDisHack0Opt1
[daysAgo] the local grid crashed here at [node]. I couldn't get to work that day, says [npc]. They docked my pay
PlyDisHack0Opt2
My [who] went bat crazy [daysAgo] when the local [node] power grid shutdown. They couldn't access the Net. Cold turkey wasn't for them
PlyDisHack1Opt0
The security grid here at [node] flatlined [daysAgo]. Thieves broke into my ServoPod and stole my valuables, says [npc]
PlyDisHack1Opt1
My [who] blames the Resistance for crashing the power grid at [node], [daysAgo]. Lost all their food, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisHack1Opt2
They say it was the Resistance who crashed the Security Grid here at [node], [daysAgo], says [npc]. Don't they ever think of the little people?
PlyDisHack2Opt0
All the robots at the factory I work at here at [node], flatlined [daysAgo] when the Resistance crashed the power grid, says [npc]
PlyDisHack2Opt1
Turns out that Robots have a fatal flaw, says [npc], [job], of [node]. They flatline once the Power Grid goes down
PlyDisHack2Opt2
[mayor] blamed the power outage [daysAgo], here at [node]. on malicious Resistance hackers, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisHack3Opt0
If the Resistance is going to shut down the Power Grid here at [node] they ought to let us know beforehand, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisHack3Opt1
With my [handicap] I really suffer when the Power Grid goes down, says [npc], [job], of [node]. Hope somebody is listening
PlyDisHack3Opt2
My [who] relies on a heart machine. They can't afford to have the Power Grid go down, says [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyDisInfo0Opt0
Is it illegal to peddle information to the Resistance, asks [npc], [job], of [node]? [mayor] says that it is but who can believe them?
PlyDisInfo0Opt1
The Resistance pays really well for valuable intel on potential targets, says [npc], [job], of [node]. I could be tempted
PlyDisInfo0Opt2
My [who] sold some dubious target intel to the Resistance once and ended up with a broken leg, says [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyDisInfo1Opt0
Selling valuable target intel to the Resistance is where the big money is, says [npc], [job], of [node]. Pity I don't know anything
PlyDisInfo1Opt1
My neighbour sold inside information on a target to the Resistance. Now he lives in a real house, not in a pod like me, says [npc] of [node]
PlyDisInfo1Opt2
My [who] keeps telling me that I'll end up in jail if I try and sell target intel to the Resistance, says [npc] of [node] but what do they know?
PlyDisInfo2Opt0
[mayor] has decreed that anyone caught selling valuable target intel to the Resistance will be 'reprocessed' says [npc] of [node]. Nasty
PlyDisInfo2Opt1
Everybody at [node] knows that the [target] target that the Resistance hit [daysAgo] was because of local intel, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisInfo2Opt2
Knowledge is power, isn't it, asks [npc], [job], of [node]? That's why the Resistance hit that [target] target [daysAgo]. They had local intel
PlyDisInfo3Opt0
Remember that [target] target that the Resistance hit here at [node] [daysAgo]? I know somebody who told them how to do it, says [npc]
PlyDisInfo3Opt1
[npc] was the person who told the Resistance how to tackle the [target] target that they hit [daysAgo]. Inside knowledge, for sure
PlyDisInfo3Opt2
[mayor] is incensed about the Resistance hitting the [target] target here at [node] [daysAgo] says [npc], [job]. Someone gave them good intel
PlyDisNeutT0Opt0
[team], yep that one. Here at [node] [daysAgo] until the Resistance dealt with them, says [npc], [job]. Thank goodness
PlyDisNeutT0Opt1
I'm glad to see the back of [team]. The Resistance did a number on them here at [node], [daysAgo], says [npc], [job]
PlyDisNeutT0Opt2
Couldn't wait to get rid of [team] here at [node]. The Resistance sorted them out [daysAgo], says [npc], [job]. Well done
PlyDisNeutT1Opt0
You'd expect [team] to have behaved better when they were deployed here at [node], [daysAgo]. Apparently not, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisNeutT1Opt1
[team] must have thought that we locals here at [node] were disposable roadkill. Thank goodness the Resistance got them, [daysAgo]
PlyDisNeutT1Opt2
Nobody likes to be treated badly. So why did [team] do so at [node]? Thankfully the Resistance fixed them [daysAgo], says [npc]
PlyDisNeutT2Opt0
We here at [node] are eternally grateful to the Resistance for getting rid of [team] [daysAgo] says [npc], [job].
PlyDisNeutT2Opt1
If it wasn't for the Reistance my [who] would have been killed by [team] [daysAgo], says [npc], [job]. Go them!
PlyDisNeutT2Opt2
[team] didn't know when to stop. Messed up [node] big time. At least the Resistance knew what to do with them [daysAgo], said [npc]
PlyDisNeutT3Opt0
[team] really trod on a lot of toes when they were here at [node]. If the Resistance hadn't have got rid of them [daysAgo] we'd be in trouble
PlyDisNeutT3Opt1
We got together and called the Resistance. Asked them to get rid of [team] who were rampaging here at [node] [daysAgo]. Gone
PlyDisNeutT3Opt2
Nobody taught [team] manners. clearly. Abused us all here at [node] until the Resistance sorted them [daysAgo]. Good job, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisNews0Opt0
The 'casts here at [node], [daysAgo], really got my head spinning, says [npc], [job]. Made me think about what's really going on
PlyDisNews0Opt1
InYourFace lit up here at [node], [daysAgo], says [npc], [job]. Got me thinking about how life could be different
PlyDisNews0Opt2
Did you see that stuff on InYourFace here at [node], [daysAgo]? Showed what a disaster [mayor] was, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisNews1Opt0
Man, the 'casts here at [node] [daysAgo] went crazy, says [npc], [job]. Stuck it to the Authority, they did
PlyDisNews1Opt1
[daysAgo], the 'casts here at [node]? They were saying all kinds of wild stuff about [city], [mayor] and the Authority, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisNews1Opt2
[mayor] is worried about the 'casts here at [node] that showed up [daysAgo], says [npc], [job]. Put them in a bad light, they did
PlyDisNews2Opt0
The 'casts at [node] [daysAgo] revealed a lot of things that the Authority didn't want us to know, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisNews2Opt1
My [who] listened to those 'casts here at [node] [daysAgo] and now they thing the Authority is evil, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisNews2Opt2
Everynow and then you can catch a pirate 'cast like the one here at [node], [daysAgo], says [npc], [job]. They're worth waiting for
PlyDisNews3Opt0
If you really want to know what's going on you need to listen to the pirate 'casts like the one here at [node] [daysAgo] says [npc]
PlyDisNews3Opt1
The Authority is trying to shutdown all illegal Resistance 'casts but it's like trying to kill all cockroaches. Not going to happen, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisNews3Opt2
That last priate 'cast here at [node], [daysAgo], really let rip into the Authority and what they are doing to us, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisRecruit0Opt0
[recruit]? Yeah, I knew them. Aren't they working for the Resistance now, asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
PlyDisRecruit0Opt1
[recruit]. Always said that they were going to be famous. Does working for the Resistance qualify? I don't know, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisRecruit0Opt2
My [who] knew [recruit]. Said that they joined the Resistance [daysAgo]. Hard to tell what's true these days, says [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyDisRecruit1Opt0
My [who] knew [recruit]. Yep, the one who joined the Resistance [daysAgo]. Sent us a postcard, says [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyDisRecruit1Opt1
[recruit] was well known here at [node]. Joined the Resistance [daysAgo]. Future prospects uncertain, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisRecruit1Opt2
Nobody is supposed to know that [recruit] joined the Resistance, [daysAgo], but, hey, who doesn't, says [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyDisRecruit2Opt0
If [recruit] was so smart why did they join the Resistance [daysAgo], asks [npc], [job], of [node]? Dumb move if you ask me
PlyDisRecruit2Opt1
I hope that [recruit] made a will before they joined the Resistance, [daysAgo], says [npc], [job], of [node]. I hear that you need one
PlyDisRecruit2Opt2
Word is that [recruit] always wanted to join the Resistance. Well, they did, [daysAgo]. How about that, says [npc], [job], of [node]?
PlyDisRecruit3Opt0
We're all taking bets on how long [recruit] is going to live. They joined the Resistance [daysAgo], says [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyDisRecruit3Opt1
[recruit] is a local here here at [node]. Joined the Resistance [daysAgo], says [npc], [job], of [node]. Dead hero, I reckon
PlyDisRecruit3Opt2
The Authority got wind that [recruit] was about to join the Resistance but it was too late. Did it here at [node] [daysAgo], says [npc]
PlyDisRiot0Opt0
I got caught up in the riot at [node], [daysAgo], says [npc], [job]. That's where I got my [handicap]
PlyDisRiot0Opt1
Riots. Nothing good ever happens in a riot. Take the one here at [node] that blew up [daysAgo]. Trashed the district, says [npc]
PlyDisRiot0Opt2
I live in [city]. I shouldn't have to put up with riots. No sir. Not here at [node]. There was one only [daysAgo], says [npc], [job]
PlyDisRiot1Opt0
How am I supposed to do my shopping here at [node] if there are riots going on, asks [npc]? It was [daysAgo], and I'm still hungry
PlyDisRiot1Opt1
My [who] got caught up in the riots at [node], [daysAgo], and got their head kicked in. It's an improvement, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisRiot1Opt2
The riots here at [node] [daysAgo] really had the Authority worried. They tried everything to calm things down, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisRiot2Opt0
Not only was there a riot here at [node] [daysAgo] but it RAINED. I hate the rain, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisRiot2Opt1
[daysAgo] [node] exploded into a full scale riot zone. Everybody went ape crazy, says [npc], [job]. Who knows why?
PlyDisRiot2Opt2
When a riot hits town like it did here at [node], [daysAgo], you stay home and watch serialFlix, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisRiot3Opt0
Only fools and idiots go out during a riot, says [npc], [job], of [node]. [daysAgo], when it got nasty, I refused to get out of bed
PlyDisRiot3Opt1
My [who] likes riots. Loved the one here at [node] [daysAgo]. Couldn't get enough of it, says [npc], [job]. Unbelievable!
PlyDisRiot3Opt2
I had a good riot experience [daysAgo] here at [node]. I met somebody. We're going to have dinner together, says [npc]
PlyDisTracer0Opt0
They say the Resistance planted a Tracer here at [node] [daysAgo]. Who are they spying on, that's what I want to know, asks [npc], [job]
PlyDisTracer0Opt1
Rumour has it that the Resistance has a Tracer here at [node]. Planted it [daysAgo] to spy on the Authority, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisTracer0Opt2
My [who] thinks they know where the Tracer that the Resistance planted here at [node] [daysAgo] is. Bet they don't, says [npc]
PlyDisTracer1Opt0
There's a Tracer here at [node]. Planted [daysAgo]. The Resistance told somebody. Why did they do that, asks [npc], [job]?
PlyDisTracer1Opt1
You're not supposed to know about Resistance Tracers but who hasn't heard about the one at [node], planted [daysAgo]?
PlyDisTracer1Opt2
[mayor] has offered a bounty for information on Resistance Tracers. There's one here at [node], apparently, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisTracer2Opt0
You know when the Resistance plants a Tracer in your district 'cause the lights flicker, says [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyDisTracer2Opt1
If the Authority is so smart why can't they find the Tracer that the Resistance planted here at [node] [daysAgo] asks [npc], [job]?
PlyDisTracer2Opt2
Finding Tracers is liking finding gold at the end of the rainbow. There's one here at [node] but nobody knows where the heck it is
PlyDisTracer3Opt0
I bet I could find the Tracer planted here at [node] [daysAgo] if I really wanted to but I'm not bothering, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisTracer3Opt1
They're saying that the interference on SerialFlix is caused by a Tracer here at [node]. Sounds right to me, says [npc], [job]
PlyDisTracer3Opt2
That Tracer the Resistance inserted here at [node] [daysAgo] is making my toaster behave funny, says [npc], [job]
PlyGenRes0Opt0
[mayor] says that you can't trust the Resistance. They do things to people. I'm staying clear of them all, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyGenRes0Opt1
Everybody knows that the Resistance eats it's own people. They're cannibals, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyGenRes0Opt2
I saw the autoHanger go through several captured Resistance members yesterday. Glad that I wasn't one of them, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyGenRes0Opt3
Join the Resistance, what? Haven't they heard about my [handicap]? Besides, they eat you, don't they, asks [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyGenRes1Opt0
I hear that the Resistance treats people well, says [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyGenRes1Opt1
Nobody has said that the Resistance treats people badly, says [npc], of [node]. I hear it's a good deal
PlyGenRes1Opt2
[mayor] says that the Resistance treats their people badly but I hear that it's the opposite, says [npc], of [node]
PlyGenRes1Opt3
One day I'm going to join the Resistance, says [npc], of [node]. They really look after you
PlyGenRes2Opt0
They say that the Resistance is like the Army. I'm glad that I have a [handicap] and can't join, says [npc], [handicap] of [node]
PlyGenRes2Opt1
I hear that they treat you really badly in the Resistance, like robots, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyGenRes2Opt2
I'm not happy about my [handicap] but at least it keeps me out of the Resistance, says [npc], [job], of [node]. I hear that they mistreat you
PlyGenRes2Opt3
In a way my [handicap] is a blessing. I'm not in the Resistance. [mayor] says they aren't nice people, laments [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyGenRes3Opt0
If it wasn't for my [handicap] I'd be joining the Resistance today, says [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyGenRes3Opt1
I'd love to join the Resistance but for my [handicap]. Slows me down and I don't want to be a burden, insists [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyGenRes3Opt2
If I could be done with my [handicap] I'd be helping the Resistance take over [city]. They couldn't do a worse job than [mayor], says [npc], of [node]
PlyGenRes3Opt3
What help would I be to the Resistance with my [handicap]? [mayor] said they eat you. No thanks, says [npc], of [node]
PlyStatRes0Opt0
Is there any point to the Resistance, asks [npc], [job] of [node]? I'm too busy with dealing with my [handicap] to worry about it
PlyStatRes0Opt1
Why bother fighting progress, asks [npc], [job] of [node]? It's going to happen no matter what we do
PlyStatRes0Opt2
I'm feeling that joining the Resistance is like trying to stop the tide coming in, says [npc], [job] of [node]. What's the point of it all?
PlyStatRes0Opt3
Forget about the Resistance, says [npc], [job] of [node]. They're nothing more than a road bump for the Authority. Irrelevant
PlyStatRes1Opt0
It's good that the Resistance is out there fighting for us, says [npc], [job] of [node] but they aren't going to make a difference
PlyStatRes1Opt1
I think that the Resistance ought to down tools and surrender, says [npc], [job] of [node]. They are all going to get caught anyway
PlyStatRes1Opt2
[mayor] told us that the Resistance is evil and I believe him, says [npc], [job] of [node]. Anyone who blows up [city] has to be bad
PlyStatRes1Opt3
Round up all the Resistance members in [city] and feed them to the autoHanger, is what I'd do, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes2Opt0
It's the Resistance that brings hope to [city]. Without them we would be lost, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes2Opt1
Do I want my kids making coffee for robots? No, that's why I support the Resistance, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes2Opt2
You can't give up. You have to keep fighting. That's why I support the Resistance, says [npc], [job] of [node]. They are carrying the flag
PlyStatRes2Opt3
If it wasn't for the Resistance we'd all be reprocessed Robot poo, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes3Opt0
When I crawl out of my servoPod in the morning I give thanks to the Resistance  for giving me a reason to live, says [npc] of [node]
PlyStatRes3Opt1
I tell my children stories about the Resistance so that they can grow up in a world where there is hope, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes3Opt2
Religion? It's the Resistance that you've got to believe in, says [npc], [job] of [node]. Besides, the AI's run most religions now
PlyStatRes3Opt3
So do we roll over and let the AI and their Robots rule the world? No sir! We join the Resistance, is what we do, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes4Opt0
Back in my days Robots were toys that you gave to your kids, says [npc] of [node]
PlyStatRes4Opt1
I remember back when the only time you saw a robot was in the movies, says [npc] of [node]
PlyStatRes4Opt2
When I was younger my parents told me that I was smarter than any robot around, says [npc] of [node]. Not the case now
PlyStatRes4Opt3
How did those robots get to be so smart? Who did that to them? I'd like to meet the person who gave them the big brains, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes5Opt0
Whoever programmed the robots forgot the bit about them not being able to take your job, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes5Opt1
Does the AI run the world? They says it doesn't but who can tell, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?
PlyStatRes5Opt2
If the AI is so smart how come they haven't got together and killed of us humans, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?
PlyStatRes5Opt3
Should the AI run the world? Can't do a worse job than our sleazy, grubby politicians, if you ask me, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes6Opt0
I thought that the robots were supposed to work for us and not the other way around, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?
PlyStatRes6Opt1
My daughter wants to grow up and be an AI. What have we done to our children, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?
PlyStatRes6Opt2
My [who] wants to mate with a robot. I told them that they can already do that, it just costs money, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes6Opt3
Is there a future for us humans here on Earth? Maybe, but I can't see it myself, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes7Opt0
My [who] reckons we have been out evolved by the AI and their robot minions, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes7Opt1
My [who] thinks that humans and AI can happily coexist, says [npc], [job] of [node]. They also believe in fairies
PlyStatRes7Opt2
My [who] thinks that it's only a matter of time before humans become redundant, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes7Opt3
You have to believe that we humans have a future otherwise how would you get out of your servoPod in the morning, says [npc], [job] of [node]?
PlyStatRes8Opt0
My kids are taught be an AI at school. What hope is there for us, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?
PlyStatRes8Opt1
My [who] thinks we should all migrate to Mars and leave the robots to it, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes8Opt2
I know that I'm dumber than the AI but does that make me less of a person, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?
PlyStatRes8Opt3
My [who] thinks that the AI has a plan for we humans. Hope that they're right, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes9Opt0
Can a robot love? I'm going big into loving, says [npc] of [node]. I'm going to love myself into a job
PlyStatRes9Opt1
The robots answer to the AI and we poor sorry humans answer to them both, says [npc], [job] of [node]. At least that's how it seems
PlyStatRes9Opt2
Back in my days you could have a conversation with the police 'cause they were human, says [npc] of [node]. 
PlyStatRes9Opt3
Where's the fun in a future full of robots and AI, asks [npc], [job] of [node]? I'd really like there to be some fun
PlyStatRes10Opt0
My [who] thinks it was computers that got us here. That's what led to the AI and robots, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes10Opt1
My [who] thinks that is possible to out smart an AI by taking the right kind of drugs but I know better, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes10Opt2
None of my brothers or sisters have a job, says [npc] of [node]. Is that what progress is all about? 
PlyStatRes10Opt3
My [who] blames it all on the filthy rich. They can afford to buy the robots that keep our noses ground into the dirt, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes11Opt0
My [who] thinks that there is a secret room full of the heads of the flthy rich, says [npc], [job] of [node]. Just their heads, mind you
PlyStatRes11Opt1
It's the filthy rich that have messed up the world, says [npc], [job] of [node]. There's only a few of them and they own everything
PlyStatRes11Opt2
My [who] thinks that the filthy rich are immortal. That they preserve their heads in vats full of elephant piss, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes11Opt3
Back in my days there was this thing called the middle class, says [npc], [job] of [node]. It meant you were a somebody
PlyStatRes12Opt0
My [who] is convinced that the filthy rich let the AI gene splice their children into super kids. It's a scary thought, says [npc] of [node]
PlyStatRes12Opt1
Life is pretty simple these days, says [npc] of [node]. There's the filthy rich, the AI, the robots. Plus us but we don't count
PlyStatRes12Opt2
My [who] thinks that the filthy rich steal children so that their kids can learn how to hunt. Doesn't sound right to me, says [npc] of [node]
PlyStatRes12Opt3
My [who] thinks that the Megacorps aren't run by the filthy rich but instead secretly by the AI, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes13Opt0
I tell my kids to be nice to the robots 'cause they are going to be in charge soon. Don't want to upset your boss, says [npc] of [node]
PlyStatRes13Opt1
My [who] is convinced that the filthy rich do head transplants onto new bodies to stop getting old, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes13Opt2
My [who] tried begging the other day. Problem is that robots don't care about us poor humans. Give it up I told them, says [npc] of [node]
PlyStatRes13Opt3
My [who] is convinced that there aren't any real live filthy rich humans left. They are all robots in disguise, says [npc], [job] of [node]
PlyStatRes14Opt0
Aren't the robots the ones making all the food, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?
PlyStatRes14Opt1
How are we going to live if the Resistance gets rid of all the robots, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?
PlyStatRes14Opt2
Nobody likes robots telling you what to do but aren't they kind of essential for everyday life, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?
PlyStatRes14Opt3
I don't know if the Resistance has thought things through, says [npc], [job] of [node]. What will we do once all the robots are gone?
PlyStatRes15Opt0
If the Resistance kills of the AI who is going to do our thinking for us, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?
PlyStatRes15Opt1
The Resistance tells us that AI is evil but aren't they the ones that give me serialFlix, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?
PlyStatRes15Opt2
I'm just a dumb human. What's going to happen if the Resistance gets rid of all the super smart AI, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?
PlyStatRes15Opt3
I like that the AI's know all about me. They have my back, says [npc], [job] of [node]. What's the Resistance going to do for me?
PlyGearRES0Opt0
The Resistance uses their special gear to steal our daughters say [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyGearRES0Opt1
[mayor] said that the Resistance is turning everybody here in [city] sterile with their illegal gear. Can you believe that, asks [npc] of [node]?
PlyGearRES0Opt2
It's voodoo, insists my [who], how the Resistance is hypnotising us all with their special gear, says [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyGearRES1Opt0
I've heard that the Resistance gets all their illegal gear from the Outer Belt, smuggled in on cargo pods, said [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyGearRES1Opt1
Resistance gear is radioactive 'cause it all comes from the Outer Belt mining stations. They make it in ZeroG says [npc], of [node]
PlyGearRES1Opt2
Resistance gear is illegal because it's better than anything you can find here on Earth, insists [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyGearRES2Opt0
My [who] is convinced that once you've touched Resistance gear your chances of making into Corporate Heaven are over, says [npc] of [node]
PlyGearRES2Opt1
There's a reason why Resistance gear has a 'Made on Mars' tag, says [npc], [job], of [node]. You can even see traces of red dust
PlyGearRES2Opt2
They make most Resistance gear on Ceres. Yep, that's right, dirty belter gear is what it is, says [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyGearRES3Opt0
If Santa dropped a piece of Resistance Gear down the air vent of my servo pod I wouldn't complain, says [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyGearRES3Opt1
Did you know that Batman uses Resistance Gear? Yep, that's our special secret, that is, says [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyGearRES3Opt2
Does [mayor] know that the Resistance has gear that can turn your brain into mush and have it dribble out your nose, asks [npc]?
PlyGearRES4Opt0
I don't believe that Resistance gear is made on Mars. Those deadbeat dust eaters don't know how to make crap, says [npc] of [node]
PlyGearRES4Opt1
Resistance gear can fry eggs and brains if used incorrectly. It's not the eggs I'm worried about, says [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyGearRES4Opt2
Geniune Resistance gear turns you into a g*dd*amnned Sexual Tyrannosaurus, swears [npc], [job], of [node]
PlyGearRES5Opt0
Who says that Resistance gear will rot your tackle, asks [npc], [job], of [node]? It will, but only if you're unlucky enough to be a man
PlyGearRES5Opt1
The Resistance can turn everybody into Zombies with special gear that messes with [citys] water supply, says [npc] of [node]
PlyGearRES5Opt2
My [who] is a goblin. A green, icky, goblin, says [npc], [job], of [node]. The Resistance did it, with their special gear
OrgCureRes0Opt0
The [org]? Religious nuts if you ask me, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes0Opt1
The [org]? They help people, says [npc], [job] of [node]. They do more good than the Authority or the Resistance
OrgCureRes0Opt2
My [who] thinks that the [org] are funded by the Authority and that you can't trust them, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes0Opt3
My [who] thinks that the [org] are an evil religious cabal that should be eradicated. Me, I don't know, says [npc], [job] of [node]?
OrgCureRes1Opt0
If it wasn't for the [org] my [who] would be dead. Can't thank them enough, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes1Opt1
The [org]? Religious crazies but aren't all religions the same, says [npc], [job] of [node]? At least they help people
OrgCureRes1Opt2
My [who] knows somebody who used to be in the [org]. They forced him to have sex with a goat, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes1Opt3
I've heard that the [org] eat people. Cannibals, all of them, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes2Opt0
If it wasn't for my [handicap] I'd seriously consider joining the [org]. I'd like to help them help others, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes2Opt1
You don't hear much about the [org], do you, asks [npc], [job] of [node]? Secretive lot
OrgCureRes2Opt2
My [who] insists that nobody has ever left the [org]. You get eaten alive if you want to leave, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes2Opt3
I've heard that the [org] originally derived from the Knights Hospitaller way back in the middle ages, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes3Opt0
It's said that the [org] are the direct descendants of some crazy twentieth century jungle juice guzzlers, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes3Opt1
Didn't the [org] come from those old nunneries, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?
OrgCureRes3Opt2
Has anyone ever seen a member of the [org]? Do they even exist, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?
OrgCureRes3Opt3
There are a lot of rumours about the [org] but I happen to know that they work for the Authority, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes4Opt0
If the [org] are religious what do they believe in? Can anyone tell me that, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?
OrgCureRes4Opt1
The [org] are aliens, put here on earth to trick us so they can eat us, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes6Opt0
If the [org] help people, like they say they do, what do they get in return, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?
OrgCureRes6Opt1
Can you join the [org]? I'd like to give them a go. They have great outfits, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes5Opt0
My [who] was helped by the [org] and now they have a [handicap], says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes5Opt1
Do the [org] really roast young children alive and eat them? Maybe, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes5Opt2
My [who] thinks that the [org] are waiting for the end of the world so that they can elope, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes5Opt3
My [who] thinks that the colour choice of the [org] signifies loyalty to the devil but isn't that supposed to be red, asks [npc] of [node]?
OrgCureRes6Opt2
My [who] thinks that the [org] are like an algae sausage, nice on the outside but ugly everywhere else, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes6Opt3
I don't know why people are down on the [org] as they have helped so many of us, asks a puzzled [npc], [job] of [node]?
OrgCureRes7Opt0
My [who] tells everybody that if you want to pass a message to somebody the best way is through the [org], says [npc]
OrgCureRes7Opt1
I've heard it said that the [org] are like a giant underground postal service. They can get a message to anyone, says [npc] of [node]
OrgCureRes7Opt2
You want to send a message to somebody and you don't know where they're at? Use the [org], says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes7Opt3
Who are the [org]? They're a message service of last resort, that's who, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes8Opt0
Can't find someone? Ask the [org]. They know where everybody is, even the lost souls,  says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes8Opt1
My [who] wants to find their lost dog and thinks that the [org] can help them. What can you do, asks [npc], [job] of
[node]?
OrgCureRes8Opt2
Rumour has it that the [org] can find lost people for a fee. If it wasn't for my [handicap] I do it myself, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes8Opt3
If I got lost, really lost, would the [org] know where I am? My [who] thinks that they would, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes9Opt0
The [org] are collecting everybodies DNA and putting it in a giant database. Apparently. Creepy, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes9Opt1
My [who] is worried that the [org] have their spit in a fridge somewhere. So what, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?
OrgCureRes9Opt3
If anyone is out there making clones it'd be the [org] 'cause they've got everybodies DNA, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes9Opt2
People worry about the [org] hoovering up their DNA and using it to make clones but I don't believe it, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes10Opt0
Why do the [org] want my DNA, asks [npc], [job] of [node]? What are they going to do with it? Make mini me's?
OrgCureRes10Opt1
Do I worry about the [org] and their giant fridge full of people's spit? No, not me, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes10Opt2
They (the [org]) trick you into spitting then they suck it up and put it in their giant fridge says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes10Opt3
You can't trust the [org]. They've got all our spit in a giant fridge and one day they'll do something nasty with it, says [npc] of [node]
OrgCureRes11Opt0
The [org], what's their plan? Start a new colony in the belt and fill it full of clones, asks [npc], [job] of [node]? Who knows
OrgCureRes11Opt1
If the [org] is going to make clones from their DNA database what are they going to do with the clones, asks [npc] of [node]?
OrgCureRes11Opt2
The [org] have a fridge as big as a skyscraper full of everybodies spit, insists my [who], says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes11Opt3
What's up with the [org]? If I had a huge fridge, like they say they do, I wouldn't fill it up with other peoples spit, says [npc]
OrgCureRes12Opt0
Doomsdayers. That's the [org]. Waiting for the end of the world so they can refill it with clones, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes12Opt1
Holding out for the apocalypse, are the [org]. When we're all dead they roll out their clones and take over, says [npc] of [node]
OrgCureRes12Opt2
That huge fridge full of spit that they talk about, who pays their powerbill? The [org] must be rich, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes12Opt3
That [org] are a creepy lot. Wouldn't trust them to do the right thing, no sir, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes13Opt0
Where do the [org] get all their spit to put in their fridge, asks [npc], [job] of [node]? Do people give it to them for free?
OrgCureRes13Opt1
[mayor] has told us that the [org] are a terrorist organisation and that anyone dealing with them will be shot, says [npc]
OrgCureRes13Opt2
One things for sure, [mayor] really doesn't like the [org], observes [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes13Opt3
You'd think that the Resistance would be all over the [org] but they seem to hate them just as much as [mayor] says [npc] of [node]
OrgCureRes14Opt0
Listen to the news and you'd think that the [org] are public enemy number one. Can't see it myself, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes14Opt1
I can't figure out why the Resistance hates the [org], says [npc], [job] of [node]. Who doesn't like angels?
OrgCureRes14Opt2
Nothin' angelic about 'em, says my [who]. The [org] are a bunch of evil spit stealers. Not sure I agree, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes14Opt3
My sister wanted to join the [org]. Our parents locked her in a closet for a week. Fixed that problem, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgCureRes15Opt0
What would I do with a fridge full of spit, asks [npc], [job], of [node]? Empty it out? Somebody needs to ask the [org] what they are up to
OrgCureRes15Opt1
The [org] and their spit fridge. It's kind of sick when you think about it like that, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgCureRes15Opt2
My [who] wishes that they had a fridge full of spit like the [org]. Good for world domination, they reckon, says [npc] of [node]
OrgCureRes15Opt3
My [who] dreams of controlling the world with the power of targetted gene viruses like those that the [org] are working on, says [npc] of [node]
OrgCureRes16Opt0
If the [org] are going to collect everybodies spit and put it in a giant fridge, just how big would the fridge have to be, asks [npc] of [node]?
OrgCureRes16Opt1
Would all the spit that the [org] are collecting go off one day? Or would it keep forever in their giant refrigerator, asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
OrgCureRes16Opt2
People generally don't know much about the [org] apart from the fact that they are collecting everybodies spit, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgCureRes16Opt3
The [org] are nothing but a wierd spit collecting cult that is waiting for the end of the world to arrive, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgConRes0Opt0
If you don't have any empathy you can kill anyone, says [npc], [job] of [node]. That's why the [org] give everybody a bypass
OrgConRes0Opt1
If only it wasn't for my [handicap], says [npc] of [node], I'd be join the [org] in a flash. Who cares about the empathy bypass?
OrgConRes0Opt2
My [who] knows somebody from the [org]. They eat puppies for breakfast, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgConRes0Opt3
The [org]? Cold blooded killers with an empathy bypass. What's not to like, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?
OrgConRes1Opt0
My [who] has a friend who used to be [npcIs] until they joined the [org]. Not anymore, they aren't, says [npc] of [node]
OrgConRes1Opt1
Somebody has to kill people. At least the [org] do it properly. You wouldn't want it to be messy, says [npc] of [node]
OrgConRes1Opt2
Did you hear what the [org] do to people who inform on them? They ram nanoRats up their backside, says [npc] of [node]
OrgConRes1Opt3
Does the [org] do jobs for The Authority? Wouldn't be surprised, says [npc], [job] of [node]. As long as they pay
OrgConRes2Opt0
My [who] swears that the [org] put viperWorms in your ear if you don't do as they ask, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgConRes2Opt1
The [org]? Don't they insist that all members have an empathy bypass, asks [npc], [job] of [node]?
OrgConRes2Opt2
It's the empathy bypass requirement that prevents me from joining the [org], insists [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgConRes2Opt3
Killers, that's what the [org] are. They are given an empathy bypass so that they don't care, says [npc] of [node]
OrgConRes3Opt0
Do the [org] kill innocent people? Only if they are paid to, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgConRes3Opt1
My [handicap]? It's from my time running with the [org]. I used to be bad once, says [npc] of [node]
OrgConRes3Opt2
Who gave the [org] a license to kill? The Authority? [mayor]? Somebody must have, insists [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgConRes3Opt3
What happens to the killers of the [org] when they get old? I bet they don't cut their own throats from guilt, says [npc] of [node]
OrgConRes4Opt0
Rumour has it that if [mayor] doesn't pay off the [org] they'll be next on their list. Killers like that don't discriminate, says [npc]
OrgConRes4Opt1
Is [mayor] worried about the [org]? Isn't everybody, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgConRes5Opt0
Has the [org] every missed a target, asks [npc], [job] of [node]? I slurp speed pills, just to be on the safe side
OrgConRes5Opt1
My [who] says the [org] are using injecting nanoSnakes into your spinal column while you are asleep. Scary stuff, says [npc]
OrgConRes5Opt2
Is it true that the bullets the [org] use can go around corners? My [who] insists that they can, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgConRes5Opt3
The [org] have a saying, that the past is best forgotten. If I killed as many people as they did I'd be having amnesia as well, says [npc]
OrgConRes6Opt0
Is the empathy bypass you get when you join the [org] permanent? What if I want to get a dog one day, asks [npc] of [node]
OrgConRes6Opt1
My [who] is worried that the [org] is after them. Hide under the bed, I told them, it's the only way to be sure, says [npc] of [node]
OrgConRes6Opt2
Nobody tells you that the [org] killed their neighbour but you can always tell that's what happened, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgConRes6Opt3
My [who] loves the [org] because they only kill bad people. Maybe, if having a contract on your head makes you bad, says [npc]
OrgHQRes0Opt0
[npc] of [node] was [npcIs] until the [org] got to them. Cleaned out their accounts and left them destitute
OrgHQRes0Opt1
The [org] extort money from everybody, says [npc] of [node]. They need it for their breakaway colony on Titan
OrgHQRes0Opt2
My [who] thinks that the [org] are entitled to extort money because their breakaway colony on Titan is the future of humanity
OrgHQRes0Opt3
The [org] are nothing but a bunch of extortionists scamming money off innocents, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgHQRes1Opt0
Titan is the future, says [mayor] of [city] but I'm referring to the official colony, not the illegal [org] one
OrgHQRes1Opt1
I wish the [org] could find a better way of funding their breakaway colony on Titan, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgHQRes1Opt2
My [who] says that the [org] have some strange ideas. Everybody should look the same, apparently, says [npc] of [node]
OrgHQRes1Opt3
The [org] are genetically modifying humans on Titan so that they all look the same, insists [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgHQRes2Opt0
What are the [org] doing at their colony on Titan, asks [npc], [job], of [node]? Turning humans into clones then eating them!
OrgHQRes2Opt1
Do the [org] eat their babies? My [who] thinks so but what do they know, asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
OrgHQRes2Opt2
I've been hearing some creepy stories about the [org] and their illegal colony on Titan, says [npc], [job], of [node]. They sacrifice babies
OrgHQRes2Opt3
Why do the [org] need an illegal colony on Titan anyway? Are they abandoning Earth, asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
OrgHQRes3Opt0
If I hadn't had all my money stolen by the [org] I could have fixed my [handicap], says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgHQRes3Opt1
My [who] is saving up enough money for a passage to the [org] colony on Titan. They want to be part of the future, says [npc] of [node]
OrgHQRes3Opt2
So the [org] have an illegal colony on Titan? Why wasn't I told, asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
OrgHQRes3Opt3
Can anyone go to Titan and join the [org] colony there or do you have to sign something first, asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
OrgHQRes4Opt0
I'd be taking the first shuttle to Titan to join with the [org] at their colony if it wasn't for my [handicap], says [npc] of [node]
OrgHQRes4Opt1
There's a proper way of doing things and funding a colony on Titan by scamming people isn't it, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgHQRes5Opt0
How much does it cost the [org] to keep their breakaway colony on Titan afloat, asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
OrgHQRes5Opt1
My [who] donated all their money to the [org] because they believe that their colony will change the world, says [npc] of [node]
OrgHQRes5Opt2
The [org] sure do have some crazy ideas, says [npc], [job], of [node]. Everybody, apparently, should look the same
OrgHQRes5Opt3
My [who] went to Titan to join the [org] colony there. Nobody has heard from them since, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgHQRes6Opt0
I don't get the [org], says [npc] of [node]. They want all my money so they can turn people on Titan into clones? 
OrgHQRes6Opt1
I want money [money] but the [org] need it to fund some crazy illegal clone colony on Titan, says [npc] of [node]
OrgHQRes6Opt2
If the [org] wanted money [money] I'd understand but to turn everybody on Titan into clones? It's got me beat, says [npc] of [node]
OrgHQRes6Opt3
Who wants to live on Titan in the [org] colony of clones? Not me, that's for sure, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgHQRes7Opt0
My [who] was [npcIs] but they left everything behind and joined the [org] colony on Titan, says [npc] of [node]
OrgHQRes7Opt1
The city of [city] has no intention of contributing to the [org] colony project on Titan, says [mayor]
OrgHQRes7Opt2
If the [org] colony on Titan is such a great place why don't they advertise it, asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
OrgHQRes7Opt3
Live on Titan, in the [org] colony? Me? No thanks, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgHQRes8Opt0
Living on Titan in the [org] colony can't be any worse than here, observes [npc] of [node]
OrgHQRes8Opt1
What's wrong with Individualism? Why do the [org] want everybody on Titan to be a clone, asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
OrgHQRes8Opt2
If the [org] are turning everybody on Titan into clones how do they know who's who, asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
OrgHQRes8Opt3
Give money to the [org] for some crazy colony on Titan where everybody looks the same? No thanks, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgEmerRes2Opt0
Those [org] are trying to run the Resistance out of town, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgEmerRes2Opt1
The Resistance does a good job of sticking it to the Authority but what about those [org], asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
OrgEmerRes2Opt2
Do I think that the [org] should take over from the Reisistance? Hard to say, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgEmerRes2Opt3
Is there room for both the Resistance and the [org]? I doubt it, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgEmerRes3Opt0
My [who] reckons that the [org] are trying to do the job of the Resistance. I think that they're onto something, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgEmerRes3Opt1
My [who] wanted [money] and the [org] helped them! Perhaps I ought to put my hand up as well, says [npc] of [node]
OrgEmerRes3Opt2
The [org] do a lot of good in the community. Stuff you don't always hear about, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgEmerRes3Opt3
Dose the Resistance feel threatened by the [org]? Probably, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgEmerRes4Opt0
My [who] thinks it's great that the [org] are giving the Resistance some competition. I'm not so sure, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgEmerRes4Opt1
There's a low level turf war going on between the Resistance and the [org], says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgEmerRes5Opt0
Whose side am I on? Have to go with the Resistance as they helped me but the [org] are O.K, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgEmerRes5Opt1
Why are the [org] and the Resistance fighting each other when they should be cooperating, asks [npc], [job], of [node]?
OrgEmerRes5Opt2
My [who] wants to join the [org]. Not sure they'll have them given their [handicap] but, hey, who knows, says [npc], [job], of [node]?
OrgEmerRes5Opt3
Do the [org] help people in trouble? Sure do. Helped my [who] get out of a real pickle, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgEmerRes6Opt0
My [who] blames the [org] for their [handicap] but I don't think they had anything to do with it, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgEmerRes6Opt1
What do the [org] want? To be the next Resistance, as far as I can tell, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgEmerRes6Opt2
How bad are the [org]? Pretty damn bad, reckons my [who]. Steal your cat and eat your dog, type bad, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgEmerRes6Opt3
Would I support the [org]? You bet I would. They helped me cope with my [handicap], says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgInfoRes0Opt0
Those [org] are like a pack of dwarves with advanced banking tech, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgInfoRes0Opt1
My [who] insists that the [org] live under a mountain and never the see the light of day, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgInfoRes0Opt2
Work for the [org]? Spend my life underground, chained to a terminal, hyped on Choc Dust? Not me, says [npc] of [node]
OrgInfoRes0Opt3
Those [org], they really know what's going on, says [npc], [job] of [node]. They beaver away underground tapping into everything
OrgInfoRes1Opt0
My [who] thinks that the [org] are spying on us all. Here I was thinking that they were some kind of Swiss Bankers, says [npc] of [node]
OrgInfoRes1Opt1
Work for the [org] and you don't live long, says [npc], [job], of [node]. It's the Choc Dust. Fries your nervous system
OrgInfoRes1Opt2
Rumour has it that [mayor] has taken loans from the [org]. Risky business if that's the case. You can't trust 'em, says [npc] of [node]
OrgInfoRes1Opt3
They shrink you, insists my [who]. The [org] do. So that you can fit in their underground caves, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgInfoRes2Opt0
Once you join the [org] your life becomes screens and Choc Dust. You need one to work the other, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgInfoRes2Opt1
Even if I didn't have my [handicap] I'm not sure that I'd want to join the [org] and live underground, says [npc] of [node]
OrgInfoRes2Opt2
Remember the great crash of '28? That was the [org] trying to corner the digital currency market, says [npc] of [node]
OrgInfoRes2Opt3
My [who] blames their bankruptcy on the actions of the [org] but I think they are just harmless parasites, says [npc] of [node]
OrgInfoRes3Opt0
Have you ever tried Choc Dust? My [who] did and they could work their keyboard so fast it was scary, says [npc] of [node]
OrgInfoRes3Opt1
Choc Dust isn't for those who want to live long fulfilling lives, no sir. But if you want to burn bright it's the way to go says [npc]
OrgInfoRes3Opt2
There's [drug] and then there's Choc Dust. Both are going to kill you but you'll enjoy the ride, says [npc], [job] of [node]
OrgInfoRes3Opt3
The [org] are nothing but evil little dwarves hiding underground and messing up the world's economy, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgInfoRes4Opt0
You can't trust the [org]. They'll get you in debt then sell all your information to whoever wants it before you've finished shaking their hand
OrgInfoRes4Opt1
Damn the [org]. They did a number on my [who] and I've been having to help them out ever since, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgInfoRes5Opt0
The [org] should stay under their mountain in Switzerland and pig out on their Choc Dust, if you ask me, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgInfoRes5Opt1
The [org]? We should flood their underground hidey holes with fuel oil and burn them all, yells an angry [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgInfoRes5Opt2
Whoever heard of the [org] doing anything good for world, asks [npc], [job], of [node]? Evil little dwarves, if you ask me
OrgInfoRes5Opt3
My [who] once worked for the [org]. They're a mess, can't even slobber on their own. Nerves are shot, says [npc] of [node]
OrgInfoRes6Opt0
Money and information, that's what the [org] are all about. That and snorting huge amounts of Choc Dust, says [npc], [job], of [node]
OrgInfoRes6Opt1
My [who] thinks that the [org] are in bed with the Authority but they have it wrong. The [org] don't care who pays them, says [npc]
OrgInfoRes6Opt2
They say that the [org] pump their workers full of Choc Dust so that they forget about living in a cave, says [npc] of [node]
OrgInfoRes6Opt3
Do I want to work for the [org]? Who wants to live in a damp cave and snort Choc Dust till they die, asks [npc] of [node]?
