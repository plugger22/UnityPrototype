  descriptor: Placeholder pool needed to allow consolidation of subSubType pools into
    one at session start for validation and operational purposes. The topics within
    this pool will be removed and serve no purpose other than placeholders (or more
    likely show topics that were populated into list during the previous session which
    is handy for debugging)
