  - My [who] works for Crypticon. Says that they are the future. God like, says [npc],
    [job], of [city]. Visionaries. I hope that I'm smart enough to get a job with
    them
  - I heard that Crypticon are going to shove it to AntCorp one day, says [npc], [job],
    of [city]. Not that I care what happens to either of them. All I get are the bird
    droppings. It's hard to life on bird poop
  - Crypticon? Aren't they the MegaCorp that bribes everybody? Like all the time?
    I'm pretty sure that's them, says [npc], [job], of [city]. Nobody has ever bribed
    me. Is there some App where you can register?
  - Aren't Crypticon that evil MegaCorp that makes those tiny surveillanceBots that
    sneak up and watch me when I'm sleeping? Man is that creepy or what? says a disgusted
    [npc], [job], of [city]
  - My [who] was murdered because they spoke out against the founder of Crypticon,
    says [npc], [job], of [city]. It's not right. Sure, nobody has free speech anymore
    but why should the head of a MegaCorp care about what the little people say about
    them?
  - Crypticon is what has messed up this planet, insists [npc], [job], of [city].
    Their armies of teenie tiny surveillanceBots need to be flushed down the toilet
    along with the long haired nerd that runs the company
  - Crypticon? Aren't they a religion? Some weird surveillance worshipping cult? asks
    [npc], [job], of [city]. They sure don't act like your typical MegaCorp, do they?
    All secrets and rituals. Wacko's the lot 'em, if you ask me
  - Crypticon have those Quantum thingo farms on Luna, don't they? asks [npc], [job],
    of [city]. Where they feed chopped up people down a shute at one end and out comes
    quantum hokey pokey at the other. You won't see me with a ticket to the moon,
    no sir
  - My [who] was on Luna. Said that Crypticon had whole farms of quantum computers
    up there. Figuring out stuff. Like how to get better pictures of me on the toilet,
    says [npc], [job], of [city]
  - Is it right that Cryticon can bribe their way to the top when I can't even buy
    my way out of a jay walking infringement? asks [npc], [job], of [city]. Is that
    fair? Why is there one set of rules for MegaCorps and another for the little people?
