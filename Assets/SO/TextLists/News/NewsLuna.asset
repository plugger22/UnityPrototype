  - I hear that there are a lot of jobs going on Luna, says [npc], [job], of [city].
    I'm thinking of applying
  - My [who] has worked on Luna and they tell me that you have to do what your told,
    just like down here, says [npc], [job], of [city]
  - I hear that the parties are great on Luna. You work hard and play hard. That appeals
    to me, says [npc], [job], of [city]
  - who would be silly enough to want to work on the Hub? Luna is bad enough but floating
    around in Luna orbit all day? Crazy stuff, says [npc], [job], of [city]
  - I plan on getting married on Luna, says [npc], [job], of [city]. First I'll have
    to find a partner but there are over twenty thousand people up there already.
    I bet that they're lonely
  - Two years on Luna and that's it, you can't come home, says [npc], [job], of [city].
    It's the G's they say. Not enough up there. Your bones turn to mush. Who wants
    flaky pastry bones?
  - One good thing I've heard about living on Luna is that they don't run surveillance
    on you, says [npc], [job], of [city]. You're allowed to be yourself as long as
    you do your job right
  - My [who] got mangled on Luna. Their legs don't work anymore, says [npc], [job],
    of [city]. They can barely get out of their servoPod. Lots of accidents, apparently,
    up there
  - So if I move to Luna do I get to eat real food or is it still the half warmed
    up grey fungus mush of here? asks [npc], [job], of [city]
  - They are doing good things up on Luna, says [npc], [job], of [city]. Helping mankind
    push further into the Frontier. Building ships that one day will fly all the way
    out to Pluto. That's exciting!
