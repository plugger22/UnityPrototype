  - The problem with Eurasia is that they are all Old, says [npc], [job], of [city].
    Nobody has kids anymore and can you blame them? Who wants to raise a sprog in
    this mixed up world?
  - When I look around me on the street I see the whole world. Everybody is here in
    Eurasia. But is there room for everybody? That's what I want to know, asks [npc],
    [job], of [city]
  - Who decided to make Berlin the capital of Eurasia? asks [npc], [job], of [city].
    What a crazy decision that was? I would have gone for Reykjavik myself. Site it
    right next to an active volcano
  - Who is in charge of Eurasia, that's what I'd like to know, says [npc], [job],
    of [city]. Is Berlin full of gnomes who beaver away all day or is it just a black
    box and a smart AI that does all the heavy lifting?
  - I'm proud of living in Eurasia, says [npc], [job], of [city]. It's got great spys.
    Really top notch espionage. We know how to shaft everybody else and we know how
    to do it covertly
  - How many languages are there in Eurasia? Too many, if you ask me, says [npc],
    [job], of [city]. Why don't we standardise on just one and leave it at that? It'd
    cut out a lot of the crap
  - Eurasia without Russia wouldn't be Eurasia would it? says [npc], [job], of [city].
    It's Russia that puts the Asia into Eurasia. Their oil and gas doesn't hurt either.
  - People get upset about the gunboats in the Med shooting up all those africans
    but what else can you do? asks [npc], [job], of [city]. There's a limit to how
    many people can live here.
  - The sooner that Eurasia shuts down all those little ethnic shops around the place
    and outlaws everything foreign the sooner we'll become a super power, [npc], [job],
    of [city]
  - Jeez, Eurasia sure stuffed up their colony on Mars, didn't they? says [npc], [job],
    of [city]. What a mess
