  - It's those micro drones that I can't tolerate, says [npc], [job], of [city]. They
    buzz through my bathroom window and watch me undress. A decent, god faring, drone
    wouldn't do that
  - Why do we have to put up with being watched all the time? asks [npc], [job], of
    [city]. Don't they get sick of looking at us? I mean who would want to see the
    footage anyway?
  - If you paint your nose black the surveillance can't track you, insists [npc],
    [job], of [city]. A black nose on a black face they can figure out but a black
    nose on a different face has got them beat
  - Why does the Authority want to see me naked? asks [npc], [job], of [city]. I don't
    look good naked. I know 'cause I get frightened everytime I see myself in the
    mirror. It's not pretty
  - It's hard to have a real conversation these days, says [npc], [job], of [city],
    when you know that there are Authority soundBots sneaking around buildings like
    so many creepy crawlies
  - I squashed one of those tiny Authority bugs the other day, insists [npc], [job],
    of [city]. I trod on it by accident. I hope that they don't bill me for it
  - They say that the skies are full of surveillance drones that can stay up there
    forever and track your every movement, says [npc], [job], of [city]. I'm skeptical
    about it. Even a bird has to land sometime and how are they going to follow me
    on the hyperloop?
  - Everytime I see a mirror I smile. There's cameras behind them all, you know, says
    [npc], [job] of [city]. They report you if you aren't happy. You don't want to
    a visit from the Happy Police, no sir
  - I don't mind being watched continuously, says [npc], [job], of [city]. I'm a special
    person and they could learn things from me. Perhaps make a training video of me
    and show it to others. Improve the world
  - An EMP blast from the sun is what we need, says [npc], [job], of [city]. Roast
    the tiny brains of all the Authorities surveillance bots. Cook 'em till they fry.
    Hey, this off the record, right?
