  briefingCity: There are major issues with the cities transport grid. Rolling strikes,
    ruthless crackdowns, a charismatic crime lord and a religious cult are all in
    the mix. Expect disruptions.
  briefingResistance: We are weak on the ground here. There is a need to make a splash.
    To raise our profile and generae support where we can. We are expecting big things
    of you.
  briefingMayor: Mayor Julius is one to watch. A competent administrator with a nasty
    streak who isn't afraid to crack down on dissent.
  briefingNpc: We believe that a courier, carrying a significant amount of money,
    will be transiting through London while you are there. Intercept if possible.
  briefingThreat: We aren't sure exactly what countermeasures the Authority will have
    in place but you can expect a meaningful response once you begin rattling their
    cage.
  briefingObjOne: Assassinate a key city businessman. Trevor Terror is the mastermind
    of Cork Inc. that is responsible for the massacre of families several years ago
    in order to facilitate a development
  briefingObjTwo: Make contact with the White Rabbit and use their local knowledge
    to establish a Resistance cell in the heart of the city
  briefingObjThree: Find out what you can about Silverstone Corporation. Rumour has
    it that they are doing illegal research on behalf of the Authority into gene tagging
    of innocent citizens.
