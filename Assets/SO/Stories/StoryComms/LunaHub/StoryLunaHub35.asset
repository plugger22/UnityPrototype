  textTop: Rusty is on the way OUT. If I can't get him to a proper medBot I'm going
    to LOSE him. He's not legal here. Still in hiding. Can you him a PERMIT?
  textBottom: A Luna HABITATION permit. One that'll let me take him to the nearest
    hygienic medBot ASAP. Please? Rusty means a lot to both of us
