  textTop: Rusty is in medBay with a cracked SKULL. I did that. It got him released
    from the InterroBots and he's safe. Did U look after his Parents?
  textBottom: No, you didn't. I had to get some Earth side MERCS to intervene there.
    I get the impression that U don't CARE about Rusty. Why do I BOTHER?
