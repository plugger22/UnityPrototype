  textTop: I've grabbed Rusty and shoved him into an AIR VENT. He was about to be
    WAXXED. They are killing anyone to do with the Collective
  textBottom: Don't worry. I'll make sure that he's fed and pass his messages  onto
    U. He'll have to STAY in the VENT until it's safe to shuttle down to Luna
