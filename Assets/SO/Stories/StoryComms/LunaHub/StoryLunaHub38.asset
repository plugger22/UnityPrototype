  textTop: The permit was GOLD. I dragged Rusty to the nearest medBot the moment we
    got it and plugged him in. Those medBots are SCARY looking devices
  textBottom: It fixed Rusty. Sort off. As far as I can tell, anyway. He's walking,
    breathing and talking which is a giant leap forward. So a big THANK YOU from us
