  textTop: The largest space station in the Solar System. In Luna orbit it depends
    on the Moon to supply it with resources and workers. It's the main shipbuilding
    facility for Earth.
  textMiddle: Construction of new space craft is done by a highly skilled workforce
    indentured to the Eclipse Corporation which ensure their families, back on Earth,
    receive preferential treatment
  textBottom: This works well for everybody, provided they do as they are told and
    don't raise concerns about the high incidence of worker deaths in the ZeroG construction
    bays that form most of The Hub
