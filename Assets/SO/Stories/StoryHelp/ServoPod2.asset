  textTop: There was a lot of concern that the pod culture would lead to an epidemic
    of obesity with people flopping around inside their pods and not exercising
  textMiddle: Luckily pod culture coincided with a dramatic decrease in the standard
    of living for most and their daily calorific intake tanked accordingly
  textBottom: People die in pods. Life sensors had to be fitted to avoid bodies being
    left to decay and fester. There is little sense of community within a Pod Tower
