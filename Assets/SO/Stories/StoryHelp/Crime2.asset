  textTop: This is extremely rare. The only people worth taking hostage are the Elites
    and, perhaps, their supporting technoClass. Nobody else has  sufficient money
    for a ransom
  textMiddle: While it is feasible to hijack an Elite citizen and take them hostage
    it isn't advisable. Massive resources would be applied. Captors would be quickly
    rounded up and executed
  textBottom: Hostages, if taken, are mostly done for gaining information. Then they
    are killed. There is little choice here. Either burn everything or face the consequences
