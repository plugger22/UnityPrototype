  textTop: On the face of it there is little chance of the Collective's dream of becoming
    the controlling faction in the Solar System ever coming to fruition
  textMiddle: However Luna and the Hub have developed into the Gateway to the Solar
    System. All space going ships are built in the Hub's 'yards while Luna provides
    the raw materials to do so
  textBottom: Add in a highly skilled, hard to replace, Luna based, workforce and
    perhaps it's the Collective who holds the key to the gateway?
