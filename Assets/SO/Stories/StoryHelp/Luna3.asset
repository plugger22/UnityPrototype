  textTop: The Luna Corp Trade Reps have a special status on Earth akin to that of
    a diplomat. They are above most of the laws and restrictions that apply to citizen
    of Earth
  textMiddle: While it's possible for a Trade Rep to casually murder ordinary people
    and expect to face no consequences, in practice those that do fall foul of the
    Resistance or a Cult
  textBottom: But why do it? Being a Trade Rep is an all encompassing occupation that
    leaves little time for a 'Whack a Citizen a Day' exercise program. They focus
    on their job
