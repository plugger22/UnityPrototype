  textTop: This is anomalous. The difficulty entailed in executing a ransom drop off
    and safely leaving the scene with the money is extreme. Who does that these days?
  textMiddle: In a surveillance society it is almost impossible to 'disappear' from
    a know location at a know time. Even the ransom is problematic. Cash doesn't exist.
    Credits can be traced.
  textBottom: It's not feasible. It's a suicide mission. Why do it in person when
    everything can be done remotely with anonymous avatars?
