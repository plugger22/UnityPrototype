  textTop: After the major power blocs on Earth saw their massive resource investments
    on Mars collapse they gave up any semblance of control over the Frontier
  textMiddle: It became the Wild West. If there is a law out there it's probably what's
    enforced by [mega3Corp]. You can't get to the Frontier without going on a ship
    they built
  textBottom: Cooperation is limited and profit is king. It's mankind's competitive
    capitalistic urges writ large and unrestrained in space with all the baggage that
    entails
