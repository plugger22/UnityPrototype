  textTop: The Authority run a tightly integrated surveillance operation to track
    movements and day to day activity but informants still have a place
  textMiddle: Often it's the human element that picks up clues of Resistance cells
    which would otherwise fly under the radar. Informants are actively encouraged
  textBottom: Dobbing in a previously unknown Resistance member is a recognised path
