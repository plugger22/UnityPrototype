  textTop: Forensic analyses are a commodity item done by relatively inexpensive equipment.
    Advanced pattern matching AI's handle all the processing automatically
  textMiddle: The human element has long since left Forensics. It's been decades since
    the humans could compete with the early neural AI's. There is no 'subjective'
    remaining in forensics
  textBottom: Medical imagery of all forms has benefited from the more advanced software
    available today. AI's have left humans floundering in their wake
