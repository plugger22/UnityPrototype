  textTop: There is a debate about the morality of the Petal. Does she eat new borns
    for lunch? Would she be capable of giving birth to a non-headless baby?
  textMiddle: Questions rage about whether there is a place on Earth for a highly
    augumented killing machine? What societal function does such a person serve?
  textBottom: The 'Save the Petal' campaign points out the benefits to all of culling
    individuals from the herd. Didn't long extinct Lions do just that to great acclaim?
