  textTop: In the shadows, beyond the reach of The Authority, intermediaries enable
    enforcable deals to be made between organisations and individuals
  textMiddle: Previous attempts at forcing counter parties to honour agreements using
    quantum cryptography or blockchain technologies all foundered without the human
    element
  textBottom: The Guild of Intermediaries is available to all and incur obligations
    to abide by their rules. Which, as everybody knows, involves pickled brains in
    bottles.
