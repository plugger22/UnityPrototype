  sprite: {fileID: 0}
  textTop: Nobody harms a Luna Trade Rep. They don't even think about it. Who would
    be suicidal enough to incur the combined wrath of the Blocs and MegaCorps?
  textMiddle: Trade Rep's have been killed in the past but only from accidental causes.
    Diplomatic status doesn't grant you immunity from bad luck
  textBottom: The deliberate murder of a Luna Trade Rep is an affront to the rich
    and powerful. It is not something that they are likely to let lie
