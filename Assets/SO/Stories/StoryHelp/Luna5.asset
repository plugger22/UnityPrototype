  textTop: There are around twenty thousand people permanently living on Luna. After
    two years on Luna you can no longer return to Earth. The gravitational spike sees
    to that.
  textMiddle: Luna tends to attract the individuals. The ones that don't fit into
    a surveilled, stratified, Earth bound society. The ones that don't accept their
    place at the bottom of the heap
  textBottom: While Luna Corp runs the colony there are plenty of opportunities for
    individualism to shine beyond the main, interlinked dome complex
