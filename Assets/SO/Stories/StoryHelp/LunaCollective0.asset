    orbiting space station, the Hub. There're now people on Luna who've been born
    there. They call it home

    on Earth nor the MegaCorps, especially [mega3] who own the construction bays on
    the Hub
  textBottom: The Collective dreams of a day when Earth has been vassalised by an
    independant Luna which rules the length and breadth of the Solar System
