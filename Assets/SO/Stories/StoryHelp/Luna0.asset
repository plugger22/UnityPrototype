  textTop: While Luna is primarily a resource gathering and support base for the giant
    orbiting LunaHub space station, there is a signficant amount of trade between
    it and Earth
  textMiddle: Imports, naturally, keep Luna alive although their reliance on Earth
    is diminishing over time as hydroponic farm domes gradually take up the slack
  textBottom: The low gravity environment and their down well proximity to Earth makes
    manufacturing, low mass, high-end precision equipment a profitable business
