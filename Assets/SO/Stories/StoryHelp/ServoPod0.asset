  textTop: The most common form of housing is living in a servoPod which look like
    fancy, oversized, coffins stacked two high in endless rows within enormous Pod
    Towers
  textMiddle: Communal bathroom, kitchen and limited storage facilities exist within
    the MegaCorp owned towers which can be over one hundred stories high
  textBottom: Overcrowded cities full of people subsisting on a universal basic wage
    have led to a servoPod culture. Nobody wants to live on the streets where violence
    is endemic
