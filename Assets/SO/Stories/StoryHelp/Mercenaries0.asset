  textTop: Mercs are in demand. MegaCorps in particular make use of them to resolve
    their many minor disputes. Open conflict is bad for business but covert ops flourish
  textMiddle: The power Blocs use mercs to squash dissent when it gets beyond what
    the local enforcement can handle. Deniability is a bonus but nobody really cares
  textBottom: Standing armies are no more. The Blocs resolve any territorial disputes
    with mercs as doing so keeps conflicts to small, localised, affairs fought with
    expendable contractors
