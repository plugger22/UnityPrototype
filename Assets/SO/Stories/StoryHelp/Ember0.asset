  textTop: You recall your brother, [brother], telling you about Ember. She had a
    thing for snakes. Pet snakes. Big snakes, small snakes. Real snakes and roboSnakes
  textMiddle: There was one large python specimen, might have been real, might not,
    but she called it 'Mr Ed'. It spoke to her. Told her what to do. Telepathically.
  textBottom: It rattled [brother]. Who wants a girlfriend that takes instructions
    from a SERPENT? Who wants a girlfriend that thinks snakes can TALK?
