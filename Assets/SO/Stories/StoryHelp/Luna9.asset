  textTop: Law and Order on Luna isn't a big deal. There's plenty of empty space for
    those who have the urge to pursue their own individualistic existance. But occasionally
    even that's not enough
  textMiddle: Deportation is a last resort. Luna Corp is trying hard to INCREASE the
    population, not subtract from it. A Luna citizen is somebody who has volunteered
    to be there. That's abnormal
  textBottom: Deportation used to be to Mars. For a set time before the individual
    could, hopefully, return. Now it's out onto the Frontier. Earth? Nobody is deported
    there. It'd be murder
