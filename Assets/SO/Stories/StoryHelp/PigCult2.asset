  textTop: A cult Pull Team will make extensive use of synthetic phermones to get
    close to their target. Once they gain their attention, love bombing takes over
  textMiddle: Who doesn't like to be told that they are wonderful, powerful, sexy
    and charismatic? Mix that with the sythn 'mones and you've got a powerful combination
  textBottom: With a now pliant target, the Pull Team isolates them from external
    influences and begins a systematic program of indoctrination. Few can resist
