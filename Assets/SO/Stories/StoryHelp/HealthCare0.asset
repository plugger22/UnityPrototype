  textTop: For the masses, MedBot terminals ccan you and diagnose any problems. Medications,
    if needed, are obtained via medAuthorisation chips
  textMiddle: Inserting a chip into a MedDispenser will spit out the required medicine.
    Geniune pharmacueticals cost more money than most people can afford
  textBottom: Cheap, derivative meds with dubious provenance are what spew forth from
    the MedDispensers. Best to stay healthy, if at all possible.
