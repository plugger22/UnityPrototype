  textTop: Formed in the early days of the Great Leap Into Space by Government scientists
    who were laid off due to funding cuts. They developed, and patented, the Braun
    SolidState rocket engine
  textMiddle: They are now one of the most profitable companies in the world, supply
    space craft and related logistical support to all three major power blocs. Without
    them, there would be no Frontier
  textBottom: Eclipse leases most of the construction facilities on the Luna Hub.
    If you need to order a shiny new space craft you can have it in any colour you
    want, as long as it's an Eclipse approved one.
