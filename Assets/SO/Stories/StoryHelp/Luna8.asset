  textTop: Feeding the population of Luna requires some lateral thinking and a large
    measure of understanding on the part of the population. Importing food isn't practical
    due to the gravity debt
  textMiddle: Which leave home grown algae, fungus and maggots. Don't be alarmed as
    the food scientists of Luna Corp have come up with many tasty and nutritional
    ways to combine the three
  textBottom: What is imported are flavour and spice additives. They turn yuck in
    yum. Extensive marketing helps. Luna cusine is both a tourist attraction and a
    sick joke
