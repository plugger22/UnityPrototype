  textTop: Schools and teachers still exist but only for the children of the Elite.
    Physical locations with roboTeachers cater for the techno class who keep things
    running
  textMiddle: Everybody else misses out. Education, or lack thereof,  is used as a
    weapon by The Authority to minimise the chance of organised Resistance
  textBottom: People who can't add up numbers or read are poor material for a revolution.
