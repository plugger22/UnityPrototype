  textTop: A refugee from the Southern Asian Slumscape, of indeterminate origin. Believed
    to be mentally unstable, possibly psychopathic, with numerous illegal augmentations
    of a lethal nature.
  textMiddle: Utilised by the MegaCorps to solve any 'outstanding issue' that takes
    their fancy, she is immune to Government sanctions. Reports of her death by violent
    means have repeatedly surfaced, only to fade away after yet another assassination
  textBottom: Pink, gene synthesised, petals are glued the eyelids of her victims.
    Concerned professors worry about the mental torment she must be going through,
    surrounded by death and implant induced voices. 'Save the Petal' is currently
    accepting donations
