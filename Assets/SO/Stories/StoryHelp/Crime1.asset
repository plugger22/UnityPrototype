  textTop: Anyone can call the police if they are the victim of a crime. Unless you
    are one of the Elites or their technoClass, you'll be placed on indefinite hold
  textMiddle: The police don't care what happens to you. Unless you do anything to
    threaten the continued safe working of the City. Then you'll be dealt with. Harshly
  textBottom: Justice lives on as a cheap and cheerful breakfast cereal. As in 'Do
    your stomach JUSTICE today with a mix of exotic Fungal spore muesli mix'
