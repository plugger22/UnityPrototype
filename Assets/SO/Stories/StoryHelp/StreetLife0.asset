  textTop: Life for the masses revolves around permits. You need a permit for a servoPod,
    a permit to buy food, a permit to work, a permit to travel
  textMiddle: For those that obey the rules and work within the system, obtaining
    permits is relatively straightforward although permits need to be renewed annually
  textBottom: Permits are the primary means of control by The Authority. If you transgress
    the rules, permits are withdrawn. You'll have to live on the streets
