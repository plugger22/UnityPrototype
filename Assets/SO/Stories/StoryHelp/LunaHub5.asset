  textTop: The Hub is riven throughout with void spaces used for access and servicing.
    Many of them are large enough for a human to stand up in
  textMiddle: While these would make great hidey holes they are easily searched for
    signs of life by the many service drones that constantly patrol the voids
  textBottom: The air vents are different. Nobody in their right mind would squeeze
    into a coffin sized vent where noise and air flow are ever present. There's nothing
    in a vent to interest a drone
