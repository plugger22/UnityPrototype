  textTop: 'Trade Rep''s run the Luna Corp offices on Earth and are authorised to
    sign deals on behalf of Luna. Their selection and appointment is tightly controlled '
  textMiddle: Luna Corp is not an independent body. The three power Bloc's on Earth,
    in conjunction with the MegaCorps, run Luna. They are very particular about the
    Trade Reps
  textBottom: Becoming a Trade Rep requires flexible politics. Officially the promotion
    of trade is the goal but unofficially the ongoing support of LunaHub is all that
    matters
