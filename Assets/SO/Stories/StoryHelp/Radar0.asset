  textTop: Earth is heavily surveilled. The Authority actively tracks what is going
    on where ever they can. The MegaCorps run their own, specailised, surveillance.
    It gets busy
  textMiddle: Few people have the resources required to disappear in a world where
    everything and everyone is monitored. It's possible but it requires the backing
    of an organisation
  textBottom: The Resistance and some of the larger Cults know how to lay low. There
    are elements of planning and execution required that are beyond the scope of individuals
