  textTop: Central American drug growers largely went out of business once the heat
    mites chewed through the jungle and their crops. The survivors merged and formed
    The Cartel
  textMiddle: Prevented from producting, they were forced to take up [facR1]'s offer
    of off-world synth drugs and become retail providers. Drug pushers
  textBottom: Taking advantage of the chaos in the CDZ they set up base in hidden
    bunkers, deep in the island mountains. Like spiders they have spun their web outwards
    to many cities
