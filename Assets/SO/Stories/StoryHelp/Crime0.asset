  textTop: The Elites and the technoClass that support their way of life live in secure
    gated communities that are crime free. This isn't the case for the Masses
  textMiddle: Crime is rampant. When it happens in a controlled environment such as
    a 'Pod Tower or a Corporate District, police or security are likely to intervene
  textBottom: Everywhere else is the Wild West. Overhead Security Drones monitor the
    jungle but won't vector police unless there is an imminent threat to City cohesion
