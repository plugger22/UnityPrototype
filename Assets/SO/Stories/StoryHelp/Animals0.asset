  textTop: Naturally occurring big game animals on Earth are extinct. Zoo's banked
    animal DNA decades ago in the hope that, one day, big game can return
  textMiddle: Which it has, In a manner. Gene splicing has enabled test tube animals
    but the temptation to tinker with natures base code has proven irresistable
  textBottom: Big Game is enhanced. It's faster, deadlier and more exotic than it
    ever was before. Who doesn't want a killer TigerLion prowling their perimeter?
