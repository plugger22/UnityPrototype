    their own. You need to join a gang, a cult, a group. There is safety in numbers
  textMiddle: Organ Grinders collect warm, still breathing, bodies and deliver them
    to the harversters who onsell parts to Ripper Docs and other shady operators
  textBottom: Vultures are a cannibalistic cult who consider human flesh to be the
    main ingredient of a balanced diet. They eat people alive as fresh meat is safest
