  textTop: Pod Towers work on a simple principle. The higher you are, the more expensive
    it becomes and the less likely you are to be raped or murdered inside your servoPod
  textMiddle: Street level is a danger zone with the ever present risk of violence
    or environmental disasters spilling through the doors and finding it's way to
    your 'pod
  textBottom: Permission to live in higher levels within a tower requires a special
    permit. Security measures including lockdown doors and guardBots increase with
    the level
