  textTop: There are none. Not for those that live on the street, anyway. Nobody has
    the time or resources to help those that can't help themselves
  textMiddle: In the dog eat dog world of street living it's best to be eaten quickly
    than to linger on, being slowly chewed up, one limb at a time.
  textBottom: If you're lucky enough to have a Pod Permit then there are organisations
    that can help but for those without it's a scary, short, future
