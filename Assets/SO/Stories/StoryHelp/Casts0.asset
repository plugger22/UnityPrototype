  textTop: The 'casts that can be found within the [bloc1] realm are heavily controlled
    and monitored. There is the ILLUSION of variety and independent viewpoints
  textMiddle: A sophisticated AI ensures that any 'cast is tweaked to present itself
    as an appealing and, apparently, free thinking piece for the masses voracious
    consumption
  textBottom: In reality the overwhelming majority of 'casts are propaganda and indoctrination
    dressed up as fun, mindless, entertainment. Truly independent media has long gone
