  textTop: Humans have built higher but they have also built lower. Increasingly severe
    storms and out of control UV radiation have put a premium on below ground construction
  textMiddle: '''Basement'' could refer to any structure multiple floors under ground.
    There is now almost as much sub ground building structure as there is above'
  textBottom: Technology for subterranean structures has rapidly advanced in recent
