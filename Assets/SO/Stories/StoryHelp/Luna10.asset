  textTop: Most workers on Luna or the Hub have family back on Earth. They form the
    leverage that the Luna Corp or [mega3Corp] hold over people
  textMiddle: The answer to most worker problems is to threaten the relevant person's
    family with adverse outcomes or withdrawal of privileges. Typically that's all
    that's needed to resolve the issue
  textBottom: But it works both ways. The Resistance and the Collective have both
    realised that they can do the same to the officials and [mega3] Execs 'upstairs'
    when needed
