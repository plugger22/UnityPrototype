  textTop: Any citizen of Luna who wishes to homestead will be given a hab, a loan
    and their own private crater. There is no shortage of free space
  textMiddle: Craters are desirable. They provide a sheltered environment for a habitation
    module, some radiation shielding and a clearly defined property boundary
  textBottom: Nobody who lives in a crater expects that THEIR crater will be hit by
    a meteor again. Craters give you that warm fuzzy LUCKY feeling
