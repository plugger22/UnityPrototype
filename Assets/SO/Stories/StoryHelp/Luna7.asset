  textTop: Luna consists of one main colony complex and any number of scattered mining
    operations. The lessons of Mars have sharpened the need for expansion
  textMiddle: Luna Corp will stake any citizen who wishes to homestead beyond the
    colony complex. Interest free loans and a free modular habitation sufficient for
    a family is available to anyone
  textBottom: Mining is favoured. There's a ready market for rare minerals due to
    the Hub's proximity. But self sustaining maggot farms in oxygen vats are growing
    in popularity. People have to eat
