  textTop: Over the arc of [facR1] through time, it's fair to say that their current,
    aging, hereditary leader, has made them weaker than at any point in their history
  textMiddle: The inability of their dribbling, drooling, leader to articulate a firm
    position on any policy has led to a vagueness that permeates the entire organisation
  textBottom: 'Vaccilation, back flips and indecision are what constitutes managerial
    oversight these days. Is this sustainable going forward? Can it last? '
