  textTop: Ships are built in ZeroG 'yards. The amount of energy required to enforce
    gravity in the large enclosed spaces is prohibitive and the lack of gravity makes
    construction easier
  textMiddle: Robotics have advanced dramatically but the challenge of operating in
    a full zeroG environment restricts their use to supplementary actions
  textBottom: There are numerous ZeroG robo assistants available but for complicated
    construction work there is no substitute for a skilled human in a 'Z' suit
