  textTop: One of The Pink Petals suite of illegal augumentations is rumoured to be
    a micro guillotine installed in a delicate region. A favoured form of assassination,
    it is said, is to lure her victim into an amorous assignation
  textMiddle: Naturally this is hearsay and strenously denied by the organisers of
    the 'Save the Petal' campaign who highlight the bias and stereotyping that all
    pyschopathic augumented assassins are forced to endure
  textBottom: An interesting side note is that The Pink Petal has, apparently, a memory
    like an Elephant, augmented with a solid state nanodrive. Few who upset the Petal
    live long enough to enjoy a SerialFlix season pass or can pee without a tube
