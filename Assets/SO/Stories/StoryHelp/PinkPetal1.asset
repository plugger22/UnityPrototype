  textTop: One of The Pink Petal's suite of illegal augumentations is rumoured to
    be a micro guillotine installed in a delicate area. She likes, it's said, to lure
    her victim into an amorous assignation
  textMiddle: Naturally this is hearsay and strenously denied by the 'Save the Petal'
    campaign who point to the bias and stereotyping that all pyschopathic augumented
    assassins are forced to endure
  textBottom: The Pink Petal has, apparently, a memory like a nano drive equipped
    Elephant,  Few who upset the Petal live long enough to enjoy their SerialFlix
    season pass
