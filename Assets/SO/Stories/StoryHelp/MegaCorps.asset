  textTop: There are four MegaCorps that are based on Earth although their tentacles
    extend out beyond the frontier. They are Eclipse, Orb, Dragon Corp and Crypticon
  textMiddle: The MegaCorps grew from global multinationals into something that now
    transcends any form of political or regulatory control. They are considered self-governing
    entities that cooperate with the Blocs
  textBottom: There was a fifth MegaCorp, AntBot, which recently merged into Crypticon
    after a hostile takeover that left tens of thousands dead. The MegaCorps have
    since signed a non-compete agreement.
