  textTop: The Hub orbits the Moon. It's the central point for all space travel throughout
    the Solar System. You shuttle up to the Hub from Earth and thence down to Luna.
  textMiddle: From the Hub you can catch a space freighter to Mars or beyond to the
    Frontier. Mining ships rotate out of the hub between hard rock sessions in the
    'Belts
  textBottom: There were plans to build a second Mars based ship construction and
    servicing orbital base to complement the Hub but, given the situation on Mars,
    this is now moot
