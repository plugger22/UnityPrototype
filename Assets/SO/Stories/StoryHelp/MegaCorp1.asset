  textTop: The MegaCorps tolerate the Resistance movement but only up to the point
    where they don't intefere with the pursuit of profit. Beyond this their fury knows
    no bounds
  textMiddle: While much of what the Resistance stands for is detrimental to the goals
    of the MegaCorps they see the Resistance as a useful, if limited, tool, especially
    when it comes to 'delicate' matters
  textBottom: The Resistance, in turn, reluctantly turns a blind eye to such overwhelmingly
    powerful organisations that exploit planets and people, unrestrained by morals
    or rules
