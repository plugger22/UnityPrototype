  textTop: There are many neural enhancements available for day to day use. These
    are relatively harmless but they are the exclusive domain of the Elites and technoClass
  textMiddle: Ordinary people make do with backyard versions, hacked together from
    stolen code snippets. Ripper Docs will happily give you a cocktail of glued together
    enhancements
  textBottom: Voices inside your head from all manner of dodgy enhancements mix with
    mental health issues brought on by normal life stress. There are a LOT of crazies
    out there
