  textTop: The Hub, being the largest Orbital man made structure in the Solar System,
    is an engineering marvel. It's a completely self contained life support and construction
    facility
  textMiddle: The design of the Hub incorporated many new ideas which were necessary
    because nobody had ever built something that vast in space before. The ideas,
    fortuitously, were solid
  textBottom: While incremental design is feasible through piloting smaller orbital
    constructions, at some point the sheer size of what's involved requires revolutionary
    concepts
