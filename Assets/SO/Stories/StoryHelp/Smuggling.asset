  textTop: Earth, with it's massive population of consumers, is still the main destination
    for the resources and goods from the Frontier. There's regular freighters shuttling
    back and fro
  textMiddle: The life of a long haul freighter captain is lonely, dangerous and about
    as glamorous as spending most of your life stuck inside a can with lmited sewerage
    and a construct for company
  textBottom: Many of them turn to smuggling illegal, high value, goods back to Earth,
    hidden amongst the regular cargo. Officials on Earth largely turn a blind eye.
    Pilots are needed
