  textTop: Technology for augumenting humans physically and neurologically exits.
    Due to the advantages that such augmentations grant, they are tightly restricted
    and a special permit is required
  textMiddle: Side effects are an issue. Psychologists believe that preexisting tendencies
    to meglomania or other power fantasies are turbo fuelled by augumentations. Pysch
    screening is compulsory for any applicant
  textBottom: Ripper Docs can install illegal augumentations. Any individual found
    with these faces the death penalty. That's if the weird and crazy implant voices
    don't convince you into ending it yourself first
