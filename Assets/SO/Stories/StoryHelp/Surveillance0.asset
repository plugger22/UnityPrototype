  textTop: There is a constant arms race between The Authority's rollout of surveillance
    AI and the Resistance's ability to spoof it. Deep pools of resources vs. ingenuity
  textMiddle: '[mega1Corp] develops the AI and has access to the most powerful Quantum
    Cloud farms on Luna. It''s cold up there, ideal for running Giga Qubits'
  textBottom: Surveillance is no longer just a means of control. It's now primarily
    focused on identifying and eliminating remnant Resistance activity. Rat extermination.
