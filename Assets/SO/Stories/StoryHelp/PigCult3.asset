  textTop: There is a dark undertone to the Cult of the Purple Pig. It's not something
    that is obvious or apparent to the majority of cult followers but it exists
  textMiddle: Like any large organisation operating in a dangerous, socially stratified
    world rife with natural disasters, it maintains a capability to inflict extreme
    violence
  textBottom: Whether this reflects an underlying philosophical bent or simply a practical
    take on today's uncertain world isn't known. Best not to upset the Piggies
