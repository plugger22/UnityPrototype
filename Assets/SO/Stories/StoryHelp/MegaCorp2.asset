  textTop: Whenever a MegaCorp steps outside the boundaries of acceptable behaviour
    there is a general rule applied. Does their action threaten others?
  textMiddle: If another MegaCorp of an Earth based power Bloc comes under the gun
    because of a massacre, for instance, then it is a big deal and is treated as such
  textBottom: However if nobody important is threatened or, even worse, if the massacre
    aids a power Bloc, for example, in their goals then it's just part of the rich
    tapestry of everyday business
