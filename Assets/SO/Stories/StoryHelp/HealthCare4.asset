  textTop: Medical professionals who have been disbarred from their profession typically
    transition into a second career as a RipperDoc
  textMiddle: There is no governing body that controls or authenticates RipperDocs.
    Anyone with enough moxy and exposure to sufficient canned medSims can be a 'Doc
  textBottom: Medical procedures performed by a 'Doc don't come with a guarantee.
    Buyer beware. While more money generally buys better service it doesn't necessarily
    buy experience
