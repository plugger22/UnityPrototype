  textTop: Luna's main trade partner is Earth. Distance and gravity make Mars a less
    attractive destination, even more so given the current state of the Martian colonies
  textMiddle: Luna Corp, the governing body, have set up offices in most major Terran
    cities to facilitate reciprocal trade deals and to market investment opportunities
    on Luna
  textBottom: Nobody on Luna wants to be known as being the spare appendage attached
    to the LunaHub space station. 'Stand tall, Bounce high' is their motto
