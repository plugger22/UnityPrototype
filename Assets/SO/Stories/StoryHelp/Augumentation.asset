  textTop: Technology for augumenting humans both physically and mentally has existed
    for some time. Due to the advantages that such augmentations grant, they are heavily
    restricted and a special permit is needed prior to implanting
  textMiddle: Side effects are an issue. Psychologists believe that preexisting tendencies
    to meglomania or other power fantasies are turbo fuelled by being augmented. Pysch
    screening is compulsory for any permit applicant
  textBottom: Ripper Docs will happily install illegal augumentations which result
    in the death penalty for any person caught with non-permit implants. That's if
    the weird and crazy voices don't talk you into topping yourself first
