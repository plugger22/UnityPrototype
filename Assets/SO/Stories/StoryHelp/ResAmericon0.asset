  textTop: One of the three world Resistance factions, they are the founding fathers
    of the movement. With an hereditary leadership, a third generation son is now
    in control with an aging, shaky grip.
  textMiddle: It is said that they won't rest until every last Authority figure and
    robot has been exterminated but for an organisation that relies heavily on the
    subtleties of PsyOps who can say?
  textBottom: In recent times there has been a spike in their membership being picked
    off by the Authority and it's rumoured that the Authority may have a high level
    mole within the organisation.
