  textTop: Luna Corp doesn't let just anybody live in their colony. You need a permit.
    Infrastructure is expensive. Every extra person requires air, water and living
    space
  textMiddle: New arrivals are assessed on their potential contribution versus the
    additional burden they will incur. Only those with a net positive are considered
    as potential citizens
  textBottom: Contributions can range from needed skill sets right down to an imbalance
    of the sexes. Breeding future colonists is just as important as being able to
    fix a leaky dome
