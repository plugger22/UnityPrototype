  textTop: Playing God with animal DNA has serious ethical implications. Nobody cares.
    Not any more. MegaCorps moved in and monopolised the technology
  textMiddle: State based governments were helpless. Bloc's refused to be drawn into
    complicated legal battles with the MegaCorps for the sake of ethical standards
  textBottom: Morals and ethics, it turns out, are a luxury available to those who
    don't have to worry about a degrading planet and a roiling, suppressed, population
