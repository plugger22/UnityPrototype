  textTop: The Caribbean Disaster Zone was declared back in 2035 after rising sea
    levels combined with year round super cycle Hurricanes to devastate the island
    economies
  textMiddle: Constantly battered and, largely underwater, mountain enclaves became
    the last resort. People emigrated enmasse and only the stubborn remain
  textBottom: The chaotic situation attracted those that had a need to be inconspicous
    and out of sight of the Authority. Wild weather makes the CDZ hard to monitor
