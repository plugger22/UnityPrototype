  textTop: Zero G, low temperature environments, found in any number of pop-up capsule
    labs on The Frontier, are ideal for the production of synth drugs
  textMiddle: It's the lack of atmosphere and impurities that enables the manufacture
    of almost 100% pure precursor chemicals that form the basis of the synths
  textBottom: 'While [drug] is still manufactured on Luna, the total absence of authority
    has shifted production of almost all synth drugs to The Frontier. '
