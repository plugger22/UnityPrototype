  textTop: Finding paper to write a letter on isn't easy. Deforestation, illegal logging
    and heat shrunk rainforests have turned trees into arboreal refugees
  textMiddle: Nobody manufactures wood pulp paper anymore. Tiolet technology has adapted
    to paper free operations. Electronic documents are the norm
  textBottom: 'Decent paper, not the fungus byproduct crap, can still be found in
    old notebooks hidden away in storage lockers. '
