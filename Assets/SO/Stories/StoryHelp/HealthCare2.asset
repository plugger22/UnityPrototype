  textTop: As a result of the poor reputation of what comes out of a MedDispenser,
    many alternatives are available, none of them officially recognised
  textMiddle: Few manage to provide a benefit beyond the low MedDispenser quality
    standard and many actively harm those who take them.
  textBottom: In the absence of proper medical care there is always a market for snake
    oil. Who knows, you might get lucky?
