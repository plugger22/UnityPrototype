  textTop: Anywhere out beyond Mars and her moons is the Frontier. The wild black
    yonder. It's the Penal Colony on Titan, the mining operations, the small service
    hubs.
  textMiddle: It's where the future of mankind lies. Where everything plays loose
    and fast. Where nobody will sell you life insurance and where you can still make
    huge money, if you get lucky
  textBottom: There's a lot of activity on the Frontier. It's so dispersed, secretive
    and uncoordinated that nobody really knows whats going on out there. But it's
    private. All of it.
