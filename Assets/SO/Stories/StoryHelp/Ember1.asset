  textTop: There was a big bustup between your brother, [brother], and Ember Collins.
    [brother] couldn't handle the snakes and the whispers in Ember's head from 'Mr
    Ed'
  textMiddle: Ember wasn't, however, an easy person to leave. She kept following [brother]
    despite him making it clear that it was over between them. It was over only when
    Mr Ed said so, apparently
  textBottom: '[brother] had been becoming increasingly disturbed by the regurgitated
    birds and rodents that he kept finding in his servoPod and had recently asked
    for your help'
