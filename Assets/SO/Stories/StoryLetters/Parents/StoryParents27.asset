  textTop: Did you talk to Vigo's family in [city] like I asked you too? It wasn't
    that big a deal, just your Mother and I about to be tossed out onto the street
  textBottom: You don't have to worry because Vigo has come down with a virus and
    is, apparently, laid up in hospital for the forseeable future, no thanks to you
