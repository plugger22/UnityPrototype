  textDear: '[child]'
  textTop: So no educational opportunity for young Milford, I see. Your Father is
    mightily upset and thinks that you've let the team down but I don't care.
  textBottom: Milford will happily join the Pig People and they'll teach him that
    he has six fingers and four holy toes. Ignorant crazies attract those of a similar
    ilk
