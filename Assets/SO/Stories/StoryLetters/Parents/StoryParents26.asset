  textDear: '[child]'
  textTop: I'm not sure what you did but Vigo has crawled back under his rock. We
    barely see him these days. He stays well clear of our pod bay
  textBottom: I hope that you didn't hurt anyone, but if you did, I forgive you. I'm
    sleeping better now that I know your Mother and I aren't going to be eaten alive
