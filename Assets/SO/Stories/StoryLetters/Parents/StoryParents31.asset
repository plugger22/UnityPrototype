  textDear: '[child]'
  textTop: Your Father is spending a lot of time with a kid called Milford. He says
    that the kid reminds him of you when you were young. I remember you being smarter
  textBottom: Milford is all dreams and aspirations. Wants to joint the Resistance
    one day, apparently. More likely to join the Pig Cultists, is my guess
