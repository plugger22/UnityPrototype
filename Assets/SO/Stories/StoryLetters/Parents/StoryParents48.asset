  textDear: '[child]'
  textTop: I'm back taking my insulin shots, thanks to you. I'm still shaking but
    it's getting less every day. I've hidden a spare supply in an air vent just in
    case
  textBottom: Vigo doesn't know that I have the insulin and I have to make a point
    of shaking up a storm everytime he comes past. He's a vulture, waiting for me
    to die
