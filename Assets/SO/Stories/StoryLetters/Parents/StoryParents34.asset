  textDear: '[child]'
  textTop: I've spoken to that kid, Milford, and I'm convinced he'd make a great recruit
    for the Resistance once he grows up. But he doesn't know anything
  textBottom: Milford needs an education. I'd do it if I could but I'm just a burnt
    out old fireman. The Pig People are going to grab him if we don't occupy his mind
