  textDear: Son
  textTop: God left the tap on full. Everybody on the ground floor have been flooded
    out. Five of them drowned in their servoPods while sleeping. It's the second time
    it's happened this year
  textBottom: Your Mother and I are up on the first floor but the tiles squelches
    when we walk and our servoPods are starting to fog up. I feel like I should call
    a Plumber
  textLove: Dad
