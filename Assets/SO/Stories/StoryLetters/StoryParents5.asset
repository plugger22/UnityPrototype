  textDear: '[child]'
  textTop: Your Father and I are in dire straits. The floods have returned and our
    floor is awash. Both our servoPods have shorted out.
  textBottom: If we don't move up a floor we'll drown. Your Father has tried to get
    us a permit to do so but they won't even talk to him. He's distraught. Can you
    help?
