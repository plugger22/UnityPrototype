  textDear: Son
  textTop: God left the tap on full. The ground floor has been flooded. Five people
    drowned in their servoPods while sleeping. Boy, can it rain up here
  textBottom: We're up on the first floor but the tiles squelch when we walk and our
    servoPods are starting to fog up. I'd call a plumber if there were any left to
    call
  textLove: Dad
