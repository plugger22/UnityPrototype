  textDear: '[first]'
  textTop: Julina isn't at the Luna Corp office. Well, not that they are admitting,
    anyway. The Piggies have some kind of connection with Luna. I can't figure it
    out
  textBottom: You need to find Julina. I met her when I was working on Luna. She's
    a NICE person and will help you find your Brother. Find her and you'll find him
