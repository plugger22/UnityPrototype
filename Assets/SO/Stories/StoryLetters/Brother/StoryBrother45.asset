  textDear: '[first]'
  textTop: We have come to the sharp end, you and I. They want to be paid a ransom
    in return for your brother. They are asking very little. We should do this
  textBottom: Negotiations are futile. Pay them what they want, it is an insignificant
    sum. Recover your brother. Why they aren't asking for more is a mystery?
