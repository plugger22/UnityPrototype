  textDear: '[first]'
  textTop: You didn't bother to pay the Ransom? Strange. I would have thought that
    you'd be happy to get your brother back? Clearly family is not that important
  textBottom: Regardless, tell me about the second message. It came with another toe,
    yes I know this. Your brother still has eight remaining. It isn't a concern
