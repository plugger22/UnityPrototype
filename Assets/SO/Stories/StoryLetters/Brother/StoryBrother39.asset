  textDear: '[first]'
  textTop: You failed to act. Again. This is becoming tiresome. I had to illegally
    send in one of my Merc Teams because of your lack of initiative.
  textBottom: Julina was in the basement. Dead. Murdered. Not long before my team
    breached the door. They also found signs that your Brother had been present
