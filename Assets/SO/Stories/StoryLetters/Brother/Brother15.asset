  textDear: '[first]'
  textTop: If your Brother is still alive he'll be inside the complex. Most likely
    the office as the warehouse would be too busy. We need to determine if he's there
  textBottom: I will not interfere and will leave this task to you as I cannot be
    seen to be actively helping a known Resistance Leader. You do, of course, have
    my support
