  textDear: '[first]'
  textTop: My contacts tell me that Derrick Wilson is terminally mad. He has pet 'Gators
    that eat intruders. He calls them his three wise men. Not a sane man
  textBottom: But extremely polite. I'm told that he apologies before sawing off your
    feet and feeding them to his 'Gators. They consider toes to be a delicacy. Really?
