  textDear: '[first]'
  textTop: Yes, it's unfortunate that the Cultists took your money and declined to
    release your Brother. They are known to be unpredictable and difficult
  textBottom: But you did get a second message? That is a good sign. With another
    toe? Your brother can still walk with eight toes. Nothing to be concerned about
