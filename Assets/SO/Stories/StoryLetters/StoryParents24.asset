  textDear: '[child]'
  textTop: Vigo is threatening to cancel our Pod Permits. Your Mother and I would
    have to live on the street. The thought is giving me the heebie jeebies
  textBottom: He has family living in [city]. Could you have a quiet word to them?
    Nothing bad, just enough to send a message and make Vigo back off?
