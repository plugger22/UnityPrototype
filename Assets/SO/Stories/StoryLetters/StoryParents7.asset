  textDear: Son
  textTop: The flood water has glitched out the buildings A.I and we were able to
    fake our way into permits and second floor servoPods.
  textBottom: I'm sure you tried hard to get us permits (well I sincerely hope that
    you did) but it has all worked out in the end. Dad to the rescue.
  textLove: Dad
