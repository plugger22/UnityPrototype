  textDear: '[child]'
  textTop: There's this kid called Milford. It's a dorky name, I know, but the kid's
    OK. He's bright and full of beans and wants to join the Resistance one day
  textBottom: Problem is that he's not sure if he'd be better joining those crazy
    Pig People. Kid's are pretty flakey these days but Milford has potential. I like
    him
