  backstory0: Harry once tore apart the old Hinkley Point Nuclear plant control room
    looking for valuables. He didn't find much and barely managed to stay clear of
    the roboHanger. Of course he was unemployed ever after. Hacking was his refuge.
  backstory1: Harry took it all in his stride. He rarely bothers about other folks
    expectations. Harry tends to do whatever Harry wants.
