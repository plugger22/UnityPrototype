  backstory0: Sturgeon sees himself as a Prophet. One who fortells a forthcoming apocalypse
    full of giant mechanical Godzillas consuming the Earth. While this isn't a popular
    theory it's one that Sturgeon holds to firmly with the conviction of a true believer.
  backstory1: Sturgeon casts out his sermons into the dark web in the hope of catching
    new believers. He likes the notoriety that comes with being a fire breathing prophet.
