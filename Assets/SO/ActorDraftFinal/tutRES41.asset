  backstory0: Diana grew up in a sleazy, grubby, bar. She learnt that things are hard
    come by. If you found something you held onto it. Power came to those who had
    the most things. Outsiders turned up occasionally and tried to take them away
    from her.
  backstory1: Diana traded things for favours. People were willing to help her in
    return for hard to find items. The outsiders found her well protected. Diana knows
    she is safe.
