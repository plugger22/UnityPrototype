  backstory0: Check your pockets whenever Barnaby is near. Nimble fingers and a villianous,
    crafty, nature will soon transfer their contents to the fancily attired Barnaby.
    He watches, observes and, like a true mongoose, strikes at the critical moment.
  backstory1: He has a stash. Under his Aunt's ailing ServoPod. Full of valuables.
    One day he'll cash in and buy the flashiest pair of shoes in Eurasia
