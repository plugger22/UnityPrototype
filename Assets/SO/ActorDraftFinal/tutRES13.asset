  backstory0: Benjamin was beaten up by security bots at every opportunity. They aren't
    supposed to feel emotions but, looking at them wailing on poor 'ole Benjamin,
    you'd have to say that they enjoyed it.
  backstory1: Good health and Benjamin are no longer on speaking terms but he knows
    all about explosives. You don't need muscles when you've got dynamite.
