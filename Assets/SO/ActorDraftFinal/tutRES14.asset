  backstory0: Benedict smokes an old fashioned pipe. Or he would if he could afford
    one. He ASPIRES to smoke a pipe one day. A pipe is a point of honour that would
    mark Benedict out as a thoughtful man who doesn't give a whiff about social norms.
  backstory1: Benedict considers himself to be a quiet, unsung, hero of the Resistance.
    A talent scout of repute. Some basic organisational ability would, of course,
    help.
