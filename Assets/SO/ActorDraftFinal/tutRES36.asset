  backstory0: 'Everybody knows Ben. The teacher who donned a bright red shirt, strode
    into a major Authority node and singlehandedly disabled every bot in the building.
    He is a rising star. Which suits Ben nicely. Stars get privileges and girls. '
  backstory1: The problem with being a star is that you need to keep performing at
    star level. Ben's been pondering this and has begun wondering if he is on a path
    to doom.
