  backstory0: Animal has an oversized 'E' tattooed on his chest. When asked, he will
    tell you it's because he is one of the ELITE of the Resistance. Is that a thing?
    Obviously not for you!, replies Animal. Bombs and status are what gets Animal
    out of bed in the morning
  backstory1: Being a member of the Elite blow-people-up brigade means that Animal,
    to the best of his knowlegde, has never accepted a bribe
