  backstory0: When you're born in a ServoPod and you know that one day you'll probably
    die in one, all that matters is that you die in a NICE one. Upstairs. Perhaps
    on the fifth floor above all the filth and away from the smelly plebs.
  backstory1: Cassandra's mother told her to not spend her life wallowing in sordid
    grubbiness and mutant bed bugs. Cassandra has no intention of doing so.
