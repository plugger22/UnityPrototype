  backstory0: Ian's problems started at school. A real, turn-up-in-person type of
    school out in the country. Ian rashly stated that the Authority was nothing more
    than an evil conspiracy to squash the little people. Which is what happened when
    security turned up and dealt with Ian.
  backstory1: Was that what turned Ian into a seething, vengeful, psychopath? Ian
    doesn't care. He just wants to stick it to the Man. Hard.
