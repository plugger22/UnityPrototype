  backstory0: Born in a commune belonging to the Cult of the Purple Pig, Jezzabella
    learned patience young. You don't question, you don't make sudden, jerky, movements.
    You don't act impulsively. Not if you didn't want a beating
  backstory1: No, you sat quietly and waited for your opportunity. Then, when the
    time was right, you made your move. Decisively. That's how you become a great
    hacker
