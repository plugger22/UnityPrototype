  backstory0: Scrumpy doesn't shy from of a bit of self promotion. He'll happily knock
    down the door of any Resistance member who is in need of a little re-education.
    He especially likes big, imposing, doors. Ones that attract attention when you
    smash through them
  backstory1: Scrumpy loves to travel. He hasn't yet been to Luna. A first class ticket
    isn't cheap. Scrumpy is currently accepting 'donations'
