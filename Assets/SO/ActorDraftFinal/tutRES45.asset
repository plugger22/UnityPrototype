  backstory0: Ernie knows animals. He grew up next to one of the last remaining zoos.
    Where animals festered and died slow deaths of neglect. Ernie used to creep in
    at night and let them out of their cages. Before he hunted them down and killed
    them.
  backstory1: Ernie is proud of the fact that he is the only man alive to have scalped
    and gutted a tiger, a lion and a mangy, incontinent, elephant. It's an acheivement.
