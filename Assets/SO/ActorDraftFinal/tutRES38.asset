  backstory0: Derriere has been tapped on the shoulder by the Fairy Godmother and
    her wand of loveliness. Everybody says that she is 'sweet' and 'exotic'. Like
    a orange that has been shined to perfection and given rose hued highlights.
  backstory1: Few men can resist being recruited by the citrus sensation. Few know
    that Derriere had a previous career in Policing. Cops don't smell like Derriere.
