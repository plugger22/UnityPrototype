  backstory0: If Phillip was an animal he'd be a Toucan, high up in the jungle canopy,
    laughing at those below. Flashing his exotic plumage as the sun lights up his
    lofty perch. Ready to swoop down and plunge his monstrous beak into the neck of
    an unsuspecting victim, severing their carotid artery
  backstory1: Whatever you do don't mention poor Phillip's eyesight. Toucans are supposed
    to be eagle eyed, not myopic
