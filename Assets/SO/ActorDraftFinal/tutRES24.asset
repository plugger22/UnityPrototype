  backstory0: 'Libby scrabbled through the grimy garbage that litters every street
    to find enough real plastic in order to pay for a fuzzy, intermittent, online
    course on computers. It wasn''t much of an eductation but Libby leveraged it into
    a career as a hacker. '
  backstory1: A cautious hacker. One who is petrified of being iced  and arrested.
    They chop the hands of any hackers they catch, don't they?
