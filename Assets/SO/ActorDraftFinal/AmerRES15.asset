  backstory0: Wyatt is cursed with a sense of doubt. Is she worthy of her family name?
    Can she ever match up to the impossible standards of mythological perfection?
    There are times when she looks in the mirror and wonders if it's not her who is
    the evil villian of the story
  backstory1: Once Wyatt couldn't wash for a month. The humiliating experience of
    being unclean and oozing stink has taught her the value of regular hygiene. Wyatt
    smells NICE
