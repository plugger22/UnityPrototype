  backstory0: Eddie isn't expected to be with us long. There's a history of disrespect
    and generalised bad behaviour. Sessions with HQ's only therapyBot haven't helped.
    Eddie is a bad apple, rolling around the bottom of the barrel, festering away.
  backstory1: But Eddie has a benefactor. One with political pull. Nobody is sure
    who. That's why Eddie is still here. He's hard to get rid off
