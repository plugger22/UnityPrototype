  backstory0: Like a slithering reptile who never forgets where the bodies are festering,
    Gator KNOWS where the pools of money are to be found. Scarcity isn't the issue,
    it's all about allocating the money for maximum impact. Gator doesn't take kindly
    to wastage
  backstory1: Born into money, Gator swims through the arcane, murky, depths of illegal
    financing. He consumes all that he finds
