  backstory0: Penny does weights. Lots of them. All the time. If you tried to flip
    Penny for heads or tails you'd end up as a flat, bloody, pancake, all over the
    floor. Penny doesn't care what you think, only that she doesn't have to kill you.
    Yet.
  backstory1: Personal space is a concept that Penny hasn't grasped. She likes to
    get in close. Close enough to stab or choke. Trust her at your peril.
