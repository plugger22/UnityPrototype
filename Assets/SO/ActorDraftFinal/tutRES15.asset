  backstory0: Elise was born of the Net. Avatars met and, apparently, concieved a
    child in cyberspace. As Elise tells it there were fireworks and drum crescendos
    at the time of conception to mark her as digital excellence made flesh and blood.
  backstory1: Having an ego as big as Luna tends to blind you to the harsh light of
    reality but Elise certainly knows her way around the net, nobody denies that.
