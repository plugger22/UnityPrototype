  backstory0: Dorothee is a voracious reader. She'll strap herself into an immersion
    VR rig and pump her brain cells full of knowledge until the cows come home. You'd
    think that knowing all about everything would be a useful thing and a great benefit
    to the Resistance
  backstory1: Sadly no. The more Dorothee learns, the more she worries about the state
    of the world and her place in it. Come on, it's not that bad, surely?
