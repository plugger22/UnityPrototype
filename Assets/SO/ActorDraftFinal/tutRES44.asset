  backstory0: Rudie, like a lot of people, wants to get rich. There is no 'middle-rich'
    anymore. It's either get filthy rich or stay grovelling in your grubby servoPod
    dreaming of a better world. Rudie doesn't go much on the servoPod lifestyle.
  backstory1: Rudie watches and waits. An opportunity will come. One full of social
    ladder climbing possibilities. Make sure you aren't standing in his way when it
    does.
