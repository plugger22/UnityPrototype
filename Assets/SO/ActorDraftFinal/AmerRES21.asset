  backstory0: Lilly grew up in servoPods. She lives in one now. Is that the kind of
    thing that a girl should have to put up with? Lilly thinks not. There's a house.
    A white, stand-alone, two storey, mansion in her dreams that one day she'll own
  backstory1: Nothing upsets Lilly more than pedants who try and burst her bubble
    by pointing out that NOBODY owns a house these days. That'd make anyone cranky
