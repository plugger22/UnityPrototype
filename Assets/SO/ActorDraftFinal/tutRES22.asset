  backstory0: Declan once won a race. With everybody else choking on the bad air Declan
    powered up the endless stairs, punched through the smog with grit and fortitude
    and came first. He hasn't stopped talking about it since. He'll tell you all about
    it, five times, before you ask.
  backstory1: His girlfriend left him soon after. Who wants to be talked to death
    over some bloody race? Declan does. In between coughing fits. Lungs full of smog
    do that to you.
