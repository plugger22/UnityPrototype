  backstory0: Ladd was in an accident. A floatCab malfunctioned and plummeted to the
    street. The only survivor, Ladd walked away with 'minor' head injuries. Adversity
    only makes you stronger, insists Ladd. On a good day. When he can focus. The other
    days? They're a little fuzzy
  backstory1: Don't let a hole in the head prejudice your thinking. That'd be holist.
    Ladd is a good Operator and knows his way around town
