  backstory0: Chablis recruits men better than anybody else. She lures them in like
    a black widow spider in a mating frenzy. Few can resist her siren call to arms
    for the Resistance and the chance of a cuddle. Is it ethical? Since when do ethics
    count for anything?
  backstory1: Some say that there is an industrial garbage disposal chute choked up
    with ex-Mr Chablis's who, after mating, had their heads bitten off
