  backstory0: Aurora loves her job. She considers herself one of a small group of
    elite planners who have the ability to shift the dial, whenever needed. It doesn't
    matter if she's having a bad day or she's being hunted down by the Authority,
    she'll tweak that dial or die trying.
  backstory1: It's an endearing quality that makes her an extremely valuable employee.
    Tough, loyal and smart are winning traits in anyone's Resistance movement
