  backstory0: Owen knows all about the dead. He spent time working in a morgue. Gluing
    up holes in bodies with ductBond to stop 'leakage'. Nothing worse than having
    your boots covered in 'leakage'. But the dead hold little interest to Owen. It's
    the live ones that catch his eye.
  backstory1: Owen is part of the team. Any team. Teams are full of people and some
    of them know where you can get things. Owen makes a point of knowing those people.
