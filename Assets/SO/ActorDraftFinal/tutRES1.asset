  backstory0: Erasmus was captured by the Authority one dark and stormy night. They
    tortured him. Probes were inserted up his every orifice and wriggled. Vigorously.
    Long fanged, evil red eyed rats played a role. What part of him did they nibble?
  backstory1: Erasmus isn't one for idle chatter but that's understandable. There
    are things he'd rather forget like the reason he has to pee through a tube.
