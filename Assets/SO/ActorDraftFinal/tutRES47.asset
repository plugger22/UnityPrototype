  backstory0: Charles hates animals. Nothing gets him angrier than the sight of a
    real life animal roaming the countryside. People are more important than things
    on four legs and people need to eat. Why dine on a fungus burger when you can
    have fresh rabbit stew?
  backstory1: Charles will give you a job if you to tell him how many helpless critters
    you've kicked to death in the last week. Bloody boots with brain splatter are
    a bonus.
