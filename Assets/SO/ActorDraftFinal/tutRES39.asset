  backstory0: Kara feels for everybody that she cooks or blows up. It's her personal
    cross that she bears to feel their pain. Which is in strong contrast to the thrill
    she gets from making tremendously loud bangs. If heaven was a place for Kara it
    would be an Armoury. Full of Semtex and C4
  backstory1: But the pain of her victims... It drives her to religion and a need
    for personal redemption. The Purple Pig people have welcomed her with open arms.
