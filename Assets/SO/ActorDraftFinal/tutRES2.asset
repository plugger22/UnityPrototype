  backstory0: Benedict is looking for a 'driod. They don't exist, not officially,
    but one did THINGS to him when he was asleep and he's been after it ever since.
    Vengeance powers Benedict through the endless days of struggle.
  backstory1: Don't ask him what THINGS were done to him by the driod. It's a delicate
    subject that will only get you shouted at, or worse.
