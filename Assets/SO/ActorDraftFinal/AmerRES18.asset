  backstory0: 'People mistake Aurelio''s slow drawl and quiet nature for a mental
    deficiency of some kind. A weakness. Which would be a mistake as within the body
    of a mumbling sloth, lies a rock hard survivor willing to do whatever is needed. '
  backstory1: Aurelio's specialty is his uncanny knack of seeing what isn't there.
    What's missing. What shoud be there but isn't. It's a gift.
