  backstory0: The Purple Pig people got their claws into Astrid early on. They turned
    a sweet young innocent girl into a radical, vindictive, cult follower. But you
    wouldn't know any of this as Astrid makes a point of not mentioning it.
  backstory1: Astrid harbours a secret desire to turn her back on the Purple people
    and blast off to Mars where she dreams of living on a ranch and herding those
    funky red cows.
