  backstory0: Once upon a time Eunice had children. Subsprogs that did exactly what
    she asked of them. Most of the time. Then came the day when she sold them to the
    Kid Exchange and joined the Resistance. You need to prioritise your life, says
    Eunice.
  backstory1: Kids? Who needs 'em? Not Eunice. She is a red hot Resistance recruiter,
    famed for her sacrifice. Who can measure up to that?
