  backstory0: Lorne's parents were early adopters on Luna. They left a newly born
    Lorne behind in the care of his grandparents and blasted off-planet, never to
    return. Lorne never quite managed to reconcile the moon in the night sky and the
    vid feeds from his parents, telling him to 'keep it straight'
  backstory1: Everytime Lorne sees the moon his mind drops out of gear and freewheels
    in a mishmash of conflicting emotions. Keep Lorne inside.
