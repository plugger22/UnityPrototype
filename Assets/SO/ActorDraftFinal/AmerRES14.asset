  backstory0: Princeton has an enquiring mind. He can't help it, his father was an
    intelligence analyst and his mother a quantum scientist. Princeton can ferret
    information out of anyone while simultaneously fiercely guarding his own foibles
    and weaknesses
  backstory1: There is a touch of naivety about Princetons faith in the power of knowing
    that can occasionally cause him to miss the glaringly obvious
