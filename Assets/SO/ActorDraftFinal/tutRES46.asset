  backstory0: Katie grew up a thinker. You have to be in order to help your father
    repair run down vehicles with little in the way of tools or manuals. Katie would
    figure it out logically, in between worrying about the zombie uprising that she
    is certain will take over London one day.
  backstory1: That's why she likes to pretend that she is a foreigner. The zombies
    won't eat you if you don't like greasy chips. She read that in a book. Useful
    knowledge.
