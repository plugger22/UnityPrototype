  backstory0: Goof is a wild man. He looks like he's just stepped out of the jungle
    and acts as if he's a caged animal on speed. Hidden behind this crazy act is a
    patient, meticulous, finder of things who can get you anything you want, for a
    fee
  backstory1: Why the wild act? Goof will tell you that it's about pulling in the
    women. Who wants to date Mr Fastidious? Does it work? Yaaaarrrrr!
