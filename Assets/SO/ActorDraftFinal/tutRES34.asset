  backstory0: Elena was born in a spa. One of those messy, watery, birhs loved by
    hippies and new age parents. It's illegal to do that now. Other than a mouthful
    of sludgey spa water, it turned Elena into a real life slippery Otter. One with
    sharp fangs and a hero complex.
  backstory1: Being seen to be the saviour is an important part of Elena's justification
    for her frequent use of violence. Not that it worries Elena. Stress if for the
    lesser people.
