  backstory0: Max is going to be the first person to play soccer on Mars. As far as
    he can tell, Mars doesn't yet field a team. He's going to rectify that. Sporting
    ability won't get him there but hacking will. Max rides the virtual world with
    a dead Badger on his head for 'enhancement'
  backstory1: Getting in touch with his inner animal is what Max calls it. Creepy
    is the term others use. Regardless, Max and his Badger Brain rule the virtual
    waves.
