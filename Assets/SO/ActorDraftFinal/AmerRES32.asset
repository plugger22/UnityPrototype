  backstory0: His mother died of the rad cough caught while volunteering, his father
    gunned down by a securityBot at a protest rally. Eamon grew up understanding that
    trouble gets you dead. You stay quiet, in the shadows. You run from trouble
  backstory1: Nobody disputes the fact that Eamon is a coward, least of all Eamon.
    He hopes to continue the McCoy line and you don't do that by being brave. No sir.
