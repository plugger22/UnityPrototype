  backstory0: 'Ford is the happiest bomber around. Every loud bang brings joy to his
    rebellious heart. Shredded ''bots all over creation remind him of the one, particularly
    evil, bot that stomped on his dog, Arthur. The bots have to go. It''s fun blowing
    them up. Nobody cares about bots. '
  backstory1: There are lots of bots in the world. Everyone of them a life affirming
    bundle of happiness as they tear apart. Ford smiles all the time. Wouldn't you?
