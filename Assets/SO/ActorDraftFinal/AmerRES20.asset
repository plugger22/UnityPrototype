  backstory0: Wendy has always been in trouble for sharing other people's secrets.
    She can't help hereself. The people, she insists, have a right to KNOW.  Her friends
    and family would probably reframe it as Wendy having a need to TELL.
  backstory1: Despite these obvious limitations Wendy is a promising Resistance member
    who has proven trustworthy and useful to date. Just don't tell her any secrets...
