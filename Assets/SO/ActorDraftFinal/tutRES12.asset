  backstory0: Nina was born rich. It didn't last. The Authority confiscated her families
    fortune during one of their 'Threat Reduction' purges. Swapping a luxury apartment
    for a smelly servoPod made a strong impression on young Nina. She hasn't forgotten.
  backstory1: She's here for the money. The wealth that will be restored to her family
    once the Resistance prevails. That might take a while but Nina is willing to wait.
