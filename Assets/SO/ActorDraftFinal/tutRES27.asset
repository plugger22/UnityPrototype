  backstory0: When you are half the size of other people and possessed of a cowardly
    nature you need to work hard on first impressions. James wants you to know that
    he know's people. All kinds of people. Important people. People that trust him.
  backstory1: James mixes. Where ever there are people huddled together James can
    be seen clasping hands, listening keenly and trying his utmost to be liked.
