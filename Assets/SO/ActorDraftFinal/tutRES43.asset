  backstory0: Norah sees herself as a suburban thug. One who preys on desparate citizens
    because why wouldn't you? If they weren't losers, she wouldn't have to beat them
    up. Nobodies fault but their own.
  backstory1: The Purple Pig People understand Norah and absolve her of any sin. Which
    is useful to Norah as she likes to  swim shoulder deep in bad deeds.
