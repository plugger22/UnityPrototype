  backstory0: Vinnie owes money. Quite a bit. To a podShark who just keeps circling.
    Every person that Vinnie recruits for the Resistance has to pay him a special
    sign-on 'bonus'. HQ know about it and don't care. They figure it only incentives
    Vinnie to recruit more cannon fodder
  backstory1: Vinnie is stuck in a deep hole. The more he feeds the podShark, the
    more it wants. How many people can he physically recruit in a week?
