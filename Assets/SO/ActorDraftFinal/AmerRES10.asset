  backstory0: With his parents currently doing time at the Area 9 Reeductation facility,
    Raylene has learnt the value of being a team player. You get to stay in the team,
    they look after you and you get fed. The team is the thing. Don't ever let it
    down and it'll take care of you
  backstory1: Is Raylene likely to go all rugged Mr Individualist on us? No sir. That's
    a positive. There's a lot to like about Raylene
