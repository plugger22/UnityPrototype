  backstory0: Can Carly cook? What's not in doubt is that she can mix up a mean poison.
    There are a long trail of bodies in her past. People who have done her wrong.
    Carly is not one to turn the other cheek and forgive. Vengeance is the fuel that
    cranks her engine
  backstory1: Is there a softer side to Carly? Sure there is, everybody has one. Finding
    it could be a challenge. Let us know when you succeed
