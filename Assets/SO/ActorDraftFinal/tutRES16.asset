  backstory0: Cows. Teresa had a cow once. She lived in the country with her parents.
    The cow was named 'Rosebud' and was extremely stubborn. One day it kicked Teresa
    in the head despite her patient, understanding, manner.
  backstory1: The cow died and Teresa morphed ugly. People think that she was born
    that way but she insists, that no, the cow did it. It's an important distinction.
