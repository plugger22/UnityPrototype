  backstory0: There have been generations of Rattles in the hills of old Dakota for
    as long as there were irradiated badlands. They traded to survive. Goods, guns,
    people. Whatever it took. You wanted something 'unique', you'd speak to a Rattle,
    that's just how it was
  backstory1: Young Randy, however, realised that power didn't come from selling stuff
    to scruffy strangers. No sir, power came to those who could think big
